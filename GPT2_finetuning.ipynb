    "This is a simplified script for fine-tuning GPT2 using Hugging Face's [Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should understand the basics of PyTorch and how a training loop works before getting started. [This official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) serves as an excellent introduction. Familiarity with the workings of GPT2 might be useful but isn't required. The code has been written for clarity and not re-use. I'd advise refactoring it for actual projects. I've liberally taken bits from [Chris McCormick's BERT fine-tuning tutorial](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/), [Ian Porter's GPT2 tutorial](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html) and the [Hugging Face Language model fine-tuning script](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.0.0/examples.html#language-model-fine-tuning) so full credit to them. Chris' code has pretty much provided the basis for this script - you should definitely check out his [blog](https://mccormickml.com/tutorials/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I should mention what the script doesn't cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the [nlp](https://huggingface.co/nlp/) library to load in the dataset and setting up the training workflow, which looks to streamline things rather nicely.\n",
    "- [Accumulated gradients](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) - this gives larger effective batch sizes than Colab allows (GPT2 is a large model, and anything more than a batch size of 2 would be enough to get a CUDA out of memory error on Colab).\n",
    "- [Freezing layers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/1431). This is the process of only changing the parameters in selected layers, made famous by the [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) process.\n",
    "- [Using 'past'](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html#using-the-past) when generating text. This takes in the previous state when generating successive items of text. I didn't need it.\n",
    "- [Tensor packing](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html). This is a neat way of fitting in as much training data in each batch. \n",
    "- [Hyperparameter search](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/using-hyperparameter-search-in-trainer/785/10). I settled quickly on values that seemed to produce decent values, without checking if they were optimal."

He goes to a club and meets a girl who claims to be his girlfriend Maya. The next day, he meets a second girl who claims to be his girlfriend named Maya. She also claims that they work for the police and are after a man named Sarang. She reveals that they must find a special coin and give it to Sarang, after which the cops will arrest him. This coin has a chip in it that can go into one's mind and change one's thoughts completely.  They find the coin inside Prince's shoe and give it to Sarang. Prince finds out that the second \"Maya\" is really a woman named Serena who works for Sarang. His servant P.K. works for Sarang along with her. The coin is revealed to be a fake. Just as Prince is trapped, the real Maya, who is in fact his girlfriend, saves him and tells him the actual story. The chip was put inside Prince so that he could work for Sarang. The two began running away. The chip made Prince's brain like a computer, so that once he woke up from sleep, he would forget everything.  Prince and Maya meet Sarang Chinea, who tells them a side effect: every morning when Prince wakes up, his brain crashes, which results in a lot of pain. He has only six days to live as a result. This particular day was the last day. Prince and Maya find the coin, which can save Prince, and Serena goes after them, leading to a high-profile chase. Prince manages to keep the coin safe but faints. A mysterious car arrives, pulls him in, and flees. Shortly after, Maya gets a phone call, saying she must come to a certain location if she wants Prince alive. The caller is a friend of Prince's named Mike. It is revealed that the first Maya that Prince had met at the club, is actually named Priya. Then Maya calls the police.  Priya takes the coin and runs away with it, but Mike tells Maya that he has the real coin; the one Priya fled with is a fake. While they are fixing an unconscious Prince, Priya returns, begging to be saved, but gets shot by Sarang and his gang. Prince awakes from his deep sleep. Sarang and his gang escape, but Prince puts a tracking device on Sarang. They track him down, and Prince and Sarang engage in a brief fight. Prince ultimately gets the coin and Sarang falls off a waterfall to his death.

The German garrison at the town is being relieved, though there are no officers and a lot of women in the town, among them one of the Polish women. In addition to being German, the town is also a base for the infirmary and a hospital. It is rumoured that the town has been overrun. The British are trying to hold on until the supply runs out, but can only hold a few as long as they do so before the Germans leave for safety.  Two members of the main British expatriate families of the small town are sent to visit the town and to investigate. After being driven to the main Japanese camp, one of the soldiers spots a large 'love nest' of flowers in the distance. The rest of the army evacuate before he is discovered and they decide to leave until the Germans come and help. \n"

Navigator 1 is a perfect all-night surveillance system, but an Opera Ghost 8 is preparing to take off. Ghost 8's crew must have secret orders from the mothership to do away with the three astronauts. A small, human-like crew are on board the ship; but the ship has been knocked out and the sole survivor, an android named K-3, has been left behind. K-3's programming allows the crew to communicate with Ghost 8. It tells them that the crew is being guided into their \"hiding craft\", a newly-driven, picnic-like surface-to-air vehicle called the \"Habdra\", and is being guided by a \"Dark Eyes\", a life form which hides itself within the ship. The crew discovers that K-3, while noting the dark side of his unease, has a \"drunk\". The crew notices that K-3's head noise is distracting the ship's bridge, while its robotic pilot, Perkins (Whitaker), is listening in. Information is being transmitted from the ship through the monitor system. The crew attempts to discover the \"Habdra\" and communicate with Ghost 8, but Ghost 8 stops them and advises them to turn around and leave the jungle. The crew opts to stay and wait for the \"habdra\"\n",

He quickly discovers that the base is becoming more and more dangerous as the radiation levels continue to rise, threatening to drop the revolt.

Humphrey soon becomes a folk hero when his father, a local drunk, dies under suspicious circumstances in a drunk driving accident. When the crooked land owner, Lon, retaliates by wrecking the bulldozer, the crooked land owner and his henchmen, including hired gun Joe Kerner, take over the bulldozer.  Things get worse when the land owner, Lon and his henchmen kidnap Estelle and eventually kill the deaf-mute woman. The thugs then go after Humphrey and kill him, but Estelle and Joe's men manage to escape, and the three make a run for it, where they end up at an abandoned mine.
