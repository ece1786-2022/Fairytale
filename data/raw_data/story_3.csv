He neededto cram for a test the next morning. Nothing happened. I can't wait all night, he thought.He drank another bottle. This'll give me EIGHT hours of energy, he thought. That meanthe'd be up until 4 a.m. Nothing happened. He drank another bottle. Now I'll be up till 8a.m., he thought. But that was no good, because the test started at 8 a.m. He drank anotherbottle. He started studying for the test. He couldn't concentrate. His eyes felt like they werecrossing. His head felt like it contained a live electric wire. He couldn't study, and hecouldn't sleep. Somehow, he managed to pass the test. No more cramming, he promisedhimself."
5,"The cat and the dog were talking. The cat said, ""Humans treat us better than you. If we turnup our nose at the cat food they serve us, they buy us another brand. If we're sleepy, we cansleep on the pillows in their bed."" The dog said, ""But humans take us out for walks. Theythrow Frisbees for us to catch. They put us in their tub and give us baths."" The cat said,""They don't take us for walks because there's a litter box in the house. If we want to catchsomething, we catch birds or mice. They don't give us baths because we clean ourselves.And one more thing-they respect our independence. They don't put a chain on our neckand a leash on the chain."" The dog said, ""I'd rather have a leash than have their kids pullingmy tail all the time."""
6,"It was a beautiful summer day in New York City. It was a day made for walking. John wasstanding at an intersection near the Brooklyn Bridge. He had driven over the bridge before.But he had never walked over the bridge. He started walking uphill on the pedestrian path.Many people were walking ahead of him. Many people were also walking toward him. Theywere coming from the Brooklyn side of the bridge. A bicycle path was next to thepedestrian path. Some pedestrians were walking on the bike path. A bicyclist approached.He rang his bicycle bell. Walkers slowly got out of his way. He kept ringing his bell. Johncontinued walking uphill. A man was standing next to a large ice chest. He was sellingbottled water. ""One dollar! One dollar! Ice cold water!"" he shouted. John wasn't thirsty. Hewondered how heavy that ice chest was."
7,"The pedestrian path and the bike path gradually rose above the cars. John looked down atthe cars. He was walking east, toward Brooklyn. The eastbound cars below were movingquickly. But the westbound cars, coming into NYC, were creeping along. There was a trafficjam. John was walking faster than those cars were moving. He was happy to be walkingeast instead of driving west. A nice breeze made his walk pleasant. He walked past peopletaking pictures. They were taking pictures of the bridge. They were taking pictures of theEast River. They were taking pictures of buildings. They were taking pictures of oneanother. A woman asked John to take a picture of her and her boyfriend. Or was he herhusband? He took their picture. They thanked him. He continued walking uphill. An oldman was sitting next to the handrail. He was drawing the bridge."
8,"Next to the man were about 30 drawings. They were clipped to the fence beneath thehandrail. There were drawings of bridges and buildings. There were drawings of people'sfaces. All the drawings were black and white. John thought they were beautiful. He couldn'tbelieve the price. Each drawing was only $10. They were all about 8 inches by 11 inches.""These are so beautiful,"" he told the man. The man was sitting on a folding chair. There wasanother folding chair next to him. ""Thank you,"" he said. ""I from Russia. English no good.""John said, ""But your art is very good."" ""Sit, sit,"" the man said. ""You, you."" The man pointed atJohn with his pen. He pointed at the empty chair. ""You want to draw me?"" John asked. ""Sit,sit,"" the man said. John said he didn't have time. Maybe he would stop on the way back."
9,"The man looked at John. ""Sit, sit,"" he repeated. John smiled. He waved goodbye to the man.Maybe I should buy a few drawings on my way back, he thought. Maybe that old man willbe famous some day. Maybe my drawings will be worth millions. He could see the Statue ofLiberty. It looked so small. There were many ships and boats on the river. Some boats werefull of tourists. They were going to the Statue of Liberty. They were circling ManhattanIsland. John reached the first of the two towers. He looked up. It said ""1875"" on the tower.Vendors were selling T-shirts, CDs, food, and drinks. People were taking pictures andreading plaques. John admired the tower. He admired the view. Half an hour later, hestarted walking toward the second tower. What a pleasant time he was having! What apleasant time everyone was having!"

A cranewas lifting a dumpster. The dumpster was about 20 feet in the air. He watched it rise. Whatif the cable broke? The dumpster would drop like a rock. How many people on thesidewalk would it injure? Something rolled over his foot. He looked down. A woman said,""Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?"" She was pulling her grocery cart. ""No problem,"" he said. Hewent back to watching the dumpster. ""What's so interesting?"" she asked. She looked up,too. Then he smelled something foul. It was cigarette smoke.

It sat on top of the entranceway roof. The roof was about 12 feet high. Thetop of the sculpture was higher than the fourth floor of the building. But what was it asculpture of? He wasn't sure. He could see four legs and a horse's head. The horse's mouthwas wide open. He could see a hand next to the horse's head. But where were an arm and abody? He could see other stuff that he did not recognize. So, it was a horse and a human-maybe. If the artist wanted people to wonder, he had done a good job. A plaque mightexplain this thing.

Frank said he used to, just after his wedding. ""But that wasn't sixtimes a day. And I can't remember the last time those words just popped into my head,"" hesaid. ""Do you ever say you love her?""

Please don't turn on, he thought. The computer turned on instantly. Nowwhat, he wondered. He could return the new computer. But if he returned it, he suspectedthat the power button would immediately stop working properly. Was the evil spirit testinghim? He didn't return the new computer.
