1	The Ant and the Chrysalis	"An Ant nimbly running about in the sunshine in search of food came across a Chrysalis that was very near its time of change. The Chrysalis moved its tail, and thus attracted the attention of the Ant, who then saw for the first time that it was alive. ""Poor, pitiable animal!"" cried the Ant disdainfully. ""What a sad fate is yours!
While I can run hither and thither, at my pleasure, and, if I wish, ascend the tallest tree, you lie imprisoned here in your shell, with power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail."" The Chrysalis heard all this, but did not try to make any reply. A few days after, when the Ant passed that way again, nothing but the shell remained. Wondering what had become of its contents, he felt himself suddenly
shaded and fanned by the gorgeous wings of a beautiful Butterfly. ""Behold in me,"" said the Butterfly, ""your much-pitied friend! Boast now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to listen."" So saying, the Butterfly rose in the air, and, borne along and aloft on the summer breeze, was soon lost to the sight of the Ant forever.

2	The Ant and the Dove 	"An Ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning.  A Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her.  The Ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank.  Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches.  The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot.  In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove
take wing.

3	The Ant and the Grasshopper	"In a field one summer's day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content.  An Ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.

""Why not come and chat with me,"" said the Grasshopper, ""instead of toiling and moiling in that way?""

""I am helping to lay up food for the winter,"" said the Ant, ""and recommend you to do the same.""

""Why bother about winter?"" said the Grasshopper; we have got plenty of food at present.""  But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil.  When the winter came the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer.

4	The Hare and the Tortoise	"The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals.  ""I have never yet been beaten,"" said he, ""when I put forth my full speed.  I challenge any one here to race with me.""

The Tortoise said quietly, ""I accept your challenge.""

""That is a good joke,"" said the Hare; ""I could dance round you all the way.""

""Keep your boasting till you've beaten,"" answered the Tortoise.  ""Shall we race?""

So a course was fixed and a start was made.  The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap.  The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run
up in time to save the race.

5	The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing	"A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs.  But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.

But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two. A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge, the Serpent spat some of his
poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.

""Why such airs, haughty dame, over one solitary cub?"" sneered the Vixen. ""Look at my healthy and numerous litter here, and imagine, if you are able, how a proud mother should feel."" The Lioness gave her a squelching look, and lifting up her nose, walked away, saying calmly, ""Yes, just look at that beautiful collection. What are they? Foxes!

""Pardon, O King,"" cried the little Mouse: ""forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?""  The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.  Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him on.  Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.  ""Was I not right?"" said the little Mouse.

9	Mercury and the Woodman	"A Woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river, when his axe, glancing off the trunk, flew out of his hands and fell into the water. As he stood by the water's edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared and asked him the reason for his grief. On learning what had happened, out of pity for his distress, Mercury dived into the river and, bringing up a golden axe, asked him if that was the one he had lost.
The Woodman replied that it was not, and Mercury then dived a second time, and, bringing up a silver axe, asked if that was his. ""No, that is not mine either,"" said the Woodman. Once more Mercury dived into the river, and brought up the missing axe. The Woodman was overjoyed at recovering his property, and thanked his benefactor warmly; and the latter was so pleased with his honesty that he made him a present of the other two axes.

10	The Fox and the Goat	"A Fox one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.  A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good.  Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend.  The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape.  ""If,"" said he, ""you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.""  The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back.  Steadying
himself with the Goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could.  When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, ""You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.""

He tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair. Then a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher.  Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher.  At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near

As she went along she began calculating what she would do with the money she would get for the milk.

With the money that I get from the sale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat; and when I go to market, won't all the young men come up and speak to me!  Polly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don't care.  I shall just look at her and toss my head like this.  As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail fell off it, and all the milk was spilt.

terror:  ""Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep""; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance.  The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.

16	The Story of The Three Little Pigs	"Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme And monkeys chewed tobacco, And hens took snuff to make them tough, And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O! There was an old sow with three little pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him: “Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house.” Which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it. Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said: “Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” To which the pig answered: “No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.” The wolf then answered to that: “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little pig. The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said: “Please, man, give me that furze to build a house.” Which the man did, and the pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, and said: “Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” “No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.” “Then I’ll puff, and I’ll huff, and I’ll blow your house in.” So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and he ate up the little pig. The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said: “Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with.” So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said: “Little pig, little pig, let me come in.” “No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.” “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said: “Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.” “Where?” said the little pig. “Oh, in Mr. Smith’s Home-field, and if you will be ready tomorrow morning I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some for dinner.” “Very well,” said the little pig, “I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?” “Oh, at six o’clock.” Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the wolf came (which he did about six) and who said: “Little Pig, are you ready?” The little pig said: “Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner.” The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little pig somehow or other, so he said: “Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.” “Where?” said the pig. “Down at Merry-garden,” replied the wolf, “and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o’clock tomorrow and get some apples.” Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o’clock, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but he had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When the wolf came up he said: “Little pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?” “Yes, very,” said the little pig. “I will throw you down one.” And he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig: “Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?” “Oh yes,” said the pig, “I will go; what time shall you be ready?” “At three,” said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time as usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig’s house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the little pig said: “Hah, I frightened you, then. I had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn, and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the hill.” Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him. When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever afterwards."	fairy tale		"mindfulness, foresight, perserverance, patience"
17	Rapunzel	"There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.  At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.  These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs.  It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.  One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion - Rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.  This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, what ails you, dear wife.  Ah, she replied, if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.  The man, who loved her, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.  At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.  She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily.  It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.  If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.  In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again.  But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.  How can you dare, said she with angry look, descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief.  You shall suffer for it.  Ah, answered he, let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.  My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.  Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world.  It shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.  The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her. Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window.  When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,      “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me.” Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it. After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode through the forest and passed by the tower.  Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened.  This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.  The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.  He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.  Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.” Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.  If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune, said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  let down your hair.” Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up. At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her.  But the king's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.  Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, he will love me more than old dame gothel does.  And she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said, I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down.  Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.  They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.  The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her, tell me, dame gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king's son - he is with me in a moment.  Ah. You wicked child, cried the enchantress.  What do I hear you say.  I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me.  In her anger she clutched Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.  And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery. On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair”, she let the hair down.  The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.  Aha, she cried mockingly, you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest.  The cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you. You will never see her again.  The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.  He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes.  Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.  Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.  He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept.  Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented. "	fairy tale		"patience, determination, beauty, perserverance, love"
18	Hansel and Gretel	"Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, what is to become of us. How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves. I'll tell you what, husband, answered the woman, early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest. There we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them. No, wife, said the man, I will not do that. How can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest. The wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces. O' you fool, said she, then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins, and she left him no peace until he consented. But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same, said the man. The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, now all is over with us. Be quiet, Gretel, said Hansel, do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us. And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us, and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying get up, you sluggards. We are going into the forest to fetch wood. She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, there is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else. Gretel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again. His father said, Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for. Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs. Ah, father, said Hansel, I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me. The wife said, fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys. Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road. When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold. Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away. Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, how are we to get out of the forest now. But Hansel comforted her and said, just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way. And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, you naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest. We thought you were never coming back at all. The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone. Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again. There is no other means of saving ourselves. The man's heart was heavy, and he thought, it would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children. The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says a must say b, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also. The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us. Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. Hansel, why do you stop and look round. Said the father, go on. I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me, answered Hansel. Fool. Said the woman, that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney. Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little. We are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away. When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again. When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel, we shall soon find the way, but they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. It was now three mornings since they had left their father's house. They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted. And when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. We will set to work on that, said Hansel, and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet. Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlor - nibble, nibble, gnaw who is nibbling at my little house. The children answered - the wind, the wind, the heaven-born wind, and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, oh, you dear children, who has brought you here. Do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to you. She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven. The old woman had only pretended to be so kind. She was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly, I have them, they shall not escape me again. Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks, she muttered to herself, that will be a dainty mouthful. Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him. Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded. And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat. Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. Now, then, Gretel, she cried to the girl, stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him. Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks. Dear God, do help us, she cried. If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together. Just keep your noise to yourself, said the old woman, it won't help you at all. Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire. We will bake first, said the old woman, I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough. She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. Creep in, said the witch, and see if it properly heated, so that we can put the bread in. And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said, I do not know how I am to do it. How do I get in. Silly goose, said the old woman, the door is big enough. Just look, I can get in myself, and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh. Then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death. Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, Hansel, we are saved. The old witch is dead. Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other. And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. These are far better than pebbles. Said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said, I, too, will take something home with me, and filled her pinafore full. But now we must be off, said Hansel, that we may get out of the witch's forest. When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water. We cannot cross, said Hansel, I see no foot-plank, and no bridge. And there is also no ferry, answered Gretel, but a white duck is swimming there. If I ask her, she will help us over. Then she cried - little duck, little duck, dost thou see, Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee. There's never a plank, or bridge in sight, take us across on thy back so white. The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. No, replied Gretel, that will be too heavy for the little duck. She shall take us across, one after the other. The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlor, and threw themselves round their father's neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest. The woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.

19	Dionysus and Ariadne	"One day, when Dionysus was in the form of his favorite shape, a handsome young man, dripping with jewels, he was spotted by some pirates. They thought they had stumbled across a rich prize, someone they could sell for a lot of money as a slave. Laughing cruelly, they grabbed what they thought was a rich young man (who was really the god, Dionysus), and carried him off to their pirate ship. They tied him tightly to the mast.
Dionysus found this all rather amusing. He might have waited a bit longer to see what these stupid mortals would do next, but the rope was rubbing his skin uncomfortably. Dionysus used his magical powers to push the rope away. It landed in a heap at his feet.
One of the pirates noticed the young man was no longer tied to the mast. The pirate gasped in surprise. He strongly suspected that he and his fellow pirates had made a terrible mistake. This was no ordinary mortal. Things would not go well for them if they did not quickly return the lad to shore. He pleaded with the other pirates to turn the ship about. But they tied Dionysus to the mast even more tightly than before and headed out to sea.
Dionysus waited until the ship had reached very deep water. He pushed the ropes off his body. At the same time, he waved his arm, and thick vines surged from the sea and entangled the ship. Dionysus shape shifted into a roaring lion. He sprang on the terrified pirates. Some jumped overboard to avoid his sharp claws and teeth. Soon, the only pirate left alive on board was the pirate who had begged for his release. That pirate would have gladly jumped overboard with his mates, but Dionysus used his magic to make sure that pirate's feet were stuck firmly in place.
""Is that the island of Naxos?"" Dionysus asked casually, peering ahead.
The pirate nodded, too terrified to speak.
""You can drop me off there,"" Dionysus decided. The vines fell away. With no one at the wheel, the ship moved smoothly forward, sailing calmly towards the island of Naxos.
When they arrived at the island, Dionysus leaped nimbly onto the seawall. He gave the pirate a friendly wave goodbye, and gave the ship a magical shove out to sea. No one knows if the pirate was able to pilot the ship alone, and no one (except the pirate of course) much cared.
It was there, on the island of Naxos, that Dionysus first saw the lovely Ariadne. (Abandoned by Theseus, Ariadne spent her days curled on the seawall, staring out to sea.) That day, she was fast asleep, worn out with weeping. She took his breath away, she was that beautiful. He waited patiently until Ariadne opened her eyes. She saw a handsome young man, gazing admiring at her. Ariadne felt better immediately. She told Dionysus  about her noble efforts to save Theseus and the children of Athens.
""And look where it got me,"" she sniffed. 
""You poor thing,"" Dionysus said with great sympathy. He immediately asked the lovely young Ariadne to marry him. (As often as the gods did that kind of thing, it's no wonder that so many of their marriages ended in disaster.)
Ariadne, no longer feeling forsaken or friendless, and delighted to be admired by this handsome young man, who was obviously wealthy - only look at his garments! - consented to be his wife.
Believe it or not, Ariadne and Dionysus lived happily ever after!"	myth		"love, appearance, confidence"
20	"Zeus, Hero, and Little Io"	"Once upon a time, a long time ago ...
Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades were the three sons of Cronos. When Cronos retired, the boys divided the world up between them. Zeus took the sky, Poseidon took the sea, and Hades ruled under the earth, the home of the dead. At first, it was great fun. But things had been just a bit slow lately.
Zeus thought about what he could do.
He could turn himself into an octopus and visit his brother Poseidon under the sea, but he didn't feel much like a swim.
He could visit Hades under the earth, but Hades was such a gloomy fellow.
He could hurl thunderbolts, but it wasn't much fun without a target.
He could hunt up one of the other gods. But the truth was, all the other gods were terrified of Zeus. He did have a terrible temper, but only when someone lied to him. Since the gods often lied, they mostly avoided Zeus.
He could call for his wife, Hera. But the truth was, Zeus was a little frightened of his wife, Hera.
He could find a beautiful woman. But he couldn't let Hera catch him. His wife Hera was very very jealous.
Zeus flew down to earth and looked around for something to do. He spotted two men walking along a lane. Zeus cast his voice to make it sound like somebody else was speaking. He was very good at that.
""Hey stupid,"" Zeus cast his voice loudly, hoping to start a fight.
One man turned to the other angrily. ""What did you say?"" And before you could say Zeus, fists were flying. Zeus found that very funny.
A glint on the river caught his eye. It was Io, a lovely river nymph.
""What a lovely young woman,"" Zeus said. He promptly fell in love.
Hoping to hide himself from the eagle eye of his jealous wife, Zeus covered the world with some really thick clouds. Then he flew down to Io. But Hera was not stupid. The thick coat of clouds made her suspicious immediately.
Zeus looked up. ""It's Hera!"" he gulped.
Quickly, Zeus changed Io into a cow. When Hera landed, all she found was an innocent looking Zeus standing next to a little white cow.
""This little cow appeared out of nowhere,"" he told his wife, acting surprised.
Hera was not fooled. ""What a beautiful cow,"" she gushed admiringly. ""May I have it as a present?""
Not knowing what else to do, Zeus had to agree. Hera sent the cow away under guard.
Zeus arranged for Io to be rescued and set free. He sent his son Apollo to sing the guard asleep. When the guard closed his eyes, Io ran away.
When Hera heard about it, she sent a gadfly after Io. A gadfly is a fly that bites.
""Moo moo,"" Io screamed, when the gadfly found her.
Io swam across a sea, hoping the gadfly would drown on the trip. No such luck, although Hera did name the sea between Greece and Rome after Io. Perhaps you've heard of it - the Ionian Sea? No matter.
Feeling very sorry for herself, a dispirited Io traveled next to Egypt.
It was then that Hera decided that Io had suffered enough. First, she made Zeus promise that he would never see Io again. Then she changed Io back into human form, and left her in Egypt.
Egypt was a dismal place for a river nymph. There are crocodiles in the Nile.
Back in Greece, Zeus gave a big sigh. Surely there was something he could do ....

21	The Trouble with Oracles	"Apollo decided he needed an assistant, a wise woman, an oracle. An oracle, in ancient Greece, was someone who could see the future. But Apollo did not want any old oracle to speak for him. He wanted a real one. But there weren't any real ones, not really. The oracles he had met always had vague answers.
For example, if you asked an oracle if you should plant your garden tomorrow, they might say ""the frost will be gone if the gods will it."" Not really helpful.
Apollo had the power to magically make someone truly see the future, just as he could. But Apollo didn't want to take the fun out of things. So Apollo set some ground rules for his oracle. He would use his magic to allow her to truly see the future. Apollo's rules stated that she had to tell the truth, but she could not be too specific. That would allow the possibility of misunderstanding. That would made it fun!
Apollo magically turned a young priestess into a real oracle. He magically built a special temple for her home. He magically told a few people here and there about his wonderful oracle.
It did not take long for the word to spread. People came from all over to ask Apollo's oracle a question. People had heard she could really see the future and could only tell the truth.
One day, a weary king came to the temple. He asked Apollo's oracle if he would win the battle. She smiled and told him a great king would win the battle. That was exactly what he had wanted to hear. He went away happy, leaving many gifts for the oracle behind him.
When he led his men into battle, they lost. The king was killed. But people still flocked to Apollo's oracle. They knew she had told the truth. She had to tell the truth. What a pity the king had not listened."	myth		"foresight, naivety"
22	"Hades, God of the Underworld"	"Hades ruled the Underworld. The Underworld was the place the ancient Greeks believed you went after you died. The Underworld was a big place. Some parts were really beautiful. One especially beautiful place was the Elysian Fields. That's where heroes went after they died. Some parts were not nice at all! You can guess who went there!

Hades was not in charge of death. He did not decide who lived and who died up on earth. He was in charge of assigning the dead a place to live in the Underworld. You could not argue with Hades. He was the only decision maker in the Underworld. It was not wise to anger Hades whether you were alive or dead, or you might end up someplace you really did not want to be for eternity!

Hades had a faithful and deeply loved companion, his three-headed dog, Cerberus. To give his dog a sniff at a new place, Hades came up to the surface now and then. If it was important enough, Hades even attended council meetings of the gods on Mount Olympus. But he never thought of Mount Olympus as his home. To Hades, home was the Underworld. His family visited him now and then. Zeus popped down whenever he felt like it. His nephew, Hermes, the deal maker for the gods, dropped in whenever he needed his uncle's help to smooth over or fix something.

Hades had two powerful brothers (and three sisters) - the mighty Zeus, king of the gods, and Poseidon, lord of the sea. He also had several nieces and nephews. His family, when they thought about him at all, thought Hades must be lonely down there in the Underworld, all by himself. But Hades was content. His family thought Hades rarely took time to play, but they were mistaken. Hades loved to play. One of his favorite belongings was his invisible helmet. He had a lot of fun with that.

More than anything, except for his beloved dog, Cerberus, Hades loved his golden chariot. It was his pride and joy. His chariot used to belong to a god named Helios. But Helios had retired and no longer pulled out the sun each day. (Zeus had reassigned that job to Apollo.) Hades and his beloved dog Cerberus would climb aboard his golden chariot and tear across the Underworld. The souls of the dead scattered left and right to get out of their way.

His family thought Hades would never fall in love. With whom? Nearly all the people Hades met were dead. They tried to introduce him to people, living people, but Hades was not interested. He had his hands full taking care of the scrabbles between souls down in the Underworld, and playing with his beloved dog and his favorite toys. Much to everyone's surprise, one day, while allowing his dog a sniff at the surface, Hades fell in love. That's when the trouble started. "	myth		"love, friendship"
23	Hades and the King of Corinth	"One day, the king of Corinth was busy trying to come up with an idea to solve Corinth's freshwater problem. He saw Zeus fly by, carrying a lovely river spirit in his arms.
""That Zeus,"" sighed the king. ""What a troublemaker!""
Soon after, the river-god Asopus flew by. ""Have you seen my daughter?"" he bellowed at the king.
""If you give my city a source of fresh water, I will tell you what I saw,” King Sisyphus shouted back. Immediately, a crystal-clear stream of fresh water bubbled up.
""Zeus took her that way,"" the king pointed.
The king knew Zeus would be angry when he heard what the king had done. But Corinth desperately needed a source of fresh water. And now they had one.
Sure enough, Zeus was furious. He told his brother Hades to take King Sisyphus down to the underworld immediately!
""When they tell you I am dead, do not put a gold coin under my tongue,” King Sisyphus whispered urgently to his wife. Being a good wife, she did exactly as the king had asked her.
Because the king was a very important person, Hades himself met the king at the River Styx, the entrance to the underworld. Because no gold coin was placed under his tongue, the king arrived at the entrance to the underworld as a poor beggar.
""Where is your gold coin?""  Hades demanded to know. ""How can you pay for a trip across the River Styx and arrive in the underworld?""
The king hung his head in shame. ""My wife was too cheap to pay for the passage.""
Hades’ mouth fell open. ""You go right back there and teach that women some manners.""  Hades sent the king back to earth immediately, where he was magically alive and well again.
The king and his beloved wife laughed when he told her about it. But he never told anyone else. You never knew when the gods might be listening."	myth		"appearance, cleverness"
24	Apollo and Cassandra	"Being a curious god, one day Apollo decided to swing by and take a look at the temple at Troy for himself.
Cassandra was not an oracle. She could not see into the future. She was a beautiful young priestess, with great ambition.
When Apollo swung by personally to take a look at his temple, all Cassandra saw was his beauty and his power. She gave him a saucy grin.
Apollo was delighted. Like all the gods, Apollo was very fond of making deals. He offered a deal to Cassandra. If she would give a kiss, he would give her the gift of prophecy so she could see into the future.
Cassandra did not hesitate. She took the deal. As soon as Apollo gave her the gift of prophecy, she looked eagerly into the future. What she saw made her gasp. She saw Apollo helping to destroy her beloved city of Troy. She spit in his face.
Apollo was angry of course. But could not take away his gift. He could only add to it. That's how his power worked. That's exactly what he did. He added something to his gift. From that time on, Cassandra could see the future, but no one believed a thing she said. That's what Apollo had added.
Sometime later, Cassandra warned her people that the huge wooden Trojan horse the Greeks had given Troy was hollow - full of Greek warriors, hidden inside - warriors who would destroy the city! The people of Troy did not believe her. They did not even look. They were far too busy celebrating the ""defeat"" of the Greeks, who had left the horse as a token of defeat (or so they believed.) But the horse was full of Greek warriors. That night, they crept out of the hollow horse and opened the city gates to let the Greek army in. That was the end of Troy."	myth		"beauty, appearance, foresight, deception"
25	The Reason for Seasons - Demeter and Persephone	"Demeter loved her little daughter, Persephone. They played together in the fields almost every day. As Persephone smiled up at her mother, Demeter's heart swelled with happiness, and the crops grew high and healthy. Flowers tumbled everywhere. As time passed, Persephone grew into a lovely goddess. That's when the trouble started.
Hades, the king of the underworld, was a gloomy fellow. He normally hung out in the Underworld.
One day, Hades felt restless. He decided to take his three-headed dog out for a chariot ride. Cerberus, his dog, usually stood guard at the gate to Underworld. But Hades gave his pup a break now and then. He scooped up Cerberus, and left a couple of spirits in charge instead.
Hades flew his chariot up to earth. Cerberus leaped out of the chariot and ran around, sniffing flowers with all three of his heads. The dog ran up to a lovely young woman, the goddess Persephone. Some people might have been startled if a three-headed dog came tearing up. But Persephone only laughed and scratched his heads.
Hades loved that old dog. He watched his dog playing happily with Persephone. He heard Persephone's delighted laugh. Hades fell deeply in love. Before anyone could stop him, he grabbed his niece, his dog, and his chariot and dove deep into the darkest depths of the Underworld.
Hades locked Persephone in a beautifully decorated room in the Hall of Hades. He brought her all kinds of delicious food. Persephone refused to eat. She had heard if you ate anything in Hades, you could never leave. She had every intention of leaving as soon as she could figure out how to do so.
Over a week went by. Finally, in desperate hunger, Persephone ate six pomegranate seeds. She promptly burst into tears.
She was not the only one crying. Demeter, her mother, missed her daughter terribly. She did not care if the crops died. She did not care about anything except finding her daughter. No one knows who told Zeus about it, but it was clear this could not go on. Zeus sent his son Hermes to work a deal with Hades.
This was the deal Hermes worked out: If Persephone would marry Hades, she would live as queen of the Underworld for six months each winter. In the spring, Persephone would return to earth and live there for six months. No one especially liked the deal, but everyone finally agreed.
Every spring, Demeter makes sure flowers are blooming and crops are growing and the fields are green with welcome. Every fall, when Persephone returns to the underworld, Demeter ignores the crops and flowers and lets them die. Each spring, Demeter brings everything to life again, ready to welcome her daughter's return.
To the ancient Greeks, that was the reason for seasons - winter, spring, summer, fall.

26	The 12 Labours of Hercules	"One day, while thinking up ways to kill Hercules, Hera came up with an idea. It might not kill him, but it would certainly devastate him. Using an evil magic spell, she made Hercules fall into a fit of madness. While under this spell, he butchered his wife and children. As the spell passed and his vision cleared, Hercules saw what he had done. He knew it was a mistake. He knew he had been bewitched, but he was filled with guilt. He wanted to find some way to atone for his terrible mistake, only he had no idea what to do. In desperation, he visited the most powerful wizard of his day, the Oracle at Delphi, and asked for her help.
The trouble with Oracles was that their advice was often misunderstood. This time, the Oracle was clear. She believed Hercules would never have butchered his family unless he had been in the grip of an evil spell. She had no doubt that the evil spell was probably cast by Hera. She also knew that Hercules would never forgive himself unless first he was punished. She told Hercules exactly what he needed to do to atone. She whispered that he had to visit his cousin, King Eurystheus, who would give him 12 labors (tasks) that Hercules must successfully complete. Once all 12 tasks were accomplished, Hercules would be forgiven.
""Are you sure that such a simple thing will atone for my mistake?"" Hercules asked her.
The oracle answered: ""If you complete 12 Labors, immortality will be yours."" Being an oracle, she never explained what she meant by ""immortality"" - would he live forever in legend or for real? Hercules never asked. (She would not have told him anyway.)  Hercules could barely hear her, her whisper was that soft, yet somehow, and just as the Oracle had predicted to herself, Hera's spies discovered what the Oracle had told him.
Before Hercules could arrive at his cousin's palace, Hera got there first. Eurystheus (Eury for short) was the king of a little village in the city-state of Argos. Hera convinced Eury that Hercules was coming to steal his crown! It was not enough that Hercules had killed his family, she told Eury. Now he wanted to be king! Eury believed her. Hera suggested that Eury challenge Hercules to 12 labors (missions or tasks.) If he failed, Hercules had to defend Eury from anyone who tried to take Eury's crown. Eury loved that idea. Hera and Eury designed 12 impossible tasks. They were certain that one of the 12 labors they designed would surely kill Hercules, probably the very first one. Hercules was not interested in Eury's crown, but he accepted the challenge as Hera knew he would.
Hercules not only lived, he had great adventures, discovered true friends, and rid the world of some really nasty critters. "	myth		"perserverance, deception, atonement"
27	The Nemean Lion	"The Nemean Lion had huge teeth, and skin so tough that it could not be pierced by arrows. Everyone in the land of Nemean was scared to death of it. Many hunters had tried to kill the beast, but none had succeeded.

The Nemean Lion was also smart. Several hunters had tried to trick it with poisoned meat. The lion never ate the meat. He did, however, eat the hunters.

The lion was strong. But Hercules was stronger. Hercules lured the beast into a trap and strangled it. He made a coat out of the lion's fur. He wore the lion's head as a helmet. With the cheers of the grateful people of Nemean ringing in his ears, Hercules headed for home, delighted with his new clothes.

When King Eury saw the lion's head approaching, he went screaming into his castle. It took Hercules most of one day to convince King Eury that the lion was dead.
"	myth		"cleverness, strength"
28	The Lernaean Hydra	"His second labor was to get rid of the Lernaean Hydra.

The Hydra was a big snake, a big big snake. It had nine heads. One of its heads was immortal - you couldn't kill it. King Eury made it quite clear that he did not want Hercules returning with any part of the serpent. No snake skin boots or hat or gloves.

King Eury and Hera both knew that anyone who approached the monster's den in the swamp was killed by the monster's poisonous breath. Hercules did not have a chance!

But Hercules lured the monster out of the swamp. With the help of his servant, Iolaus, he clubbed off the monster's nine heads. He burned them. But one head refused to die. It kept coming back to life. So Hercules crushed that head and buried it deep in the ground, and to this day, it was never seen again.
"	myth		"cleverness, strength"
29	The Wild Boar of Erymanthus	"His 3rd labor was to bring the wild boar of Erymanthus back to the castle, alive.

Boars are wild pigs with tusks that can cut you. And they're smart. And mean. The wild boar of Erymanthus was a gigantic boar, which made him even more dangerous.

Hercules chased the huge boar up and down the mountains for almost a week before the boar dropped in exhaustion. Hercules was barely winded. He was glad he did not have to kill the boar. Hercules had gotten quite fond of the tricky fellow.

Hercules slung the boar around his neck, and carried him home. By the time he arrived at the castle, the boar had begun to recover. Hercules dropped the boar at King Eury's feet. The boar lifted its heavy head and snorted angrily. King Eury screamed and ran away. No one saw the king for the rest of the day. As for the boar, he disappeared. Some say Hercules gave him a lift home, back to the forest."	myth		"perserverance, strength"
30	The Stag of Artemis	"His 4th labor was to capture the stag of Artemis.

There were many stags in the mountains. But this one was special. The stag of Artemis was known for its incredible beauty, its golden antlers, and its remarkable speed. It was not dangerous. It was just fast.

Hercules tried to catch the stag for a very long time without success. He had hoped to catch it without injuring it. But the stag was too fast for him. Finally, Hercules shot the stag with an arrow, being very careful to hit the stag in its leg, so the wound would heal. He tied the stag gently to a tree, and left the stag there, while he looked around for a witness who would agreed to swear to King Eury that the stag had been captured. Hercules intended to let the beautiful animal go free once he could prove he had captured it.

It took a while to find anyone who was willing to speak up to King Eury, or to any king for that matter. By the time Hercules returned, dragging his witness with him, he found the goddess Artemis standing next to the empty tree where Hercules had tied the stag. Artemis was furious when she heard that King Eury had sent Hercules after her favorite stag. But she was not furious with Hercules. She offered to be his witness. As she told Hercules, she was going to be speaking soon with King Eury anyway."	myth		"beauty, perserverance"
31	The Stymphalian Birds	"Still trying to kill him, his cousin, King Eury, gave Hercules his 5th labor - to kill the Stymphalian birds!

The Stymphalian birds were just plain nasty. The people in the area spent their days and nights hiding from these scary birds. The Stymphalian birds had pointed beaks and ripping claws and their feathers were made of razor sharp bronze. They were the stuff of nightmares!

What the Stymphalian birds loved to do more than anything was to fly high in the sky looking for anyone or anything they could attack. They especially loved to drop their sharp feathers on children and animals. You can see why everyone kept their children inside, and sheltered their animals as best they could.

Hercules made a large shield of sturdy bronze to protect his body from the feathers. He used poisoned arrows to shoot all the Stymphalian birds as they flew by overhead. When the last bird fell, the people hiding inside their huts and homes rushed outside and cheered!

Hercules made many new friends that day."	myth		"cleverness, cooperation"
32	The Augean Stables	"His 6th labor was to clean the Augean Stables in one day.

Augean, the King of Elis, had many sheep and cattle. All his sheep and cattle slept in the royal stables. This might sound nice, but the stables had not been cleaned for several years. It was not nice at all! The most horrible smell greeted Hercules when he stuck his nose in the stable door.

Obviously, it would take a great deal of water to wash away all the filth. Hercules used his mighty strength to push the riverbeds of a couple of nearby rivers and change their course, so that the rivers would rush through the stables and clean them out! It was a clever solution. The job was done in just a few hours.

Hercules put most of the river beds back where they were. But he left one babbling brook for the comfort of the animals.

When all of the animals who lived in the stable came home that night from the fields, they found clean beds of hay, warm buckets of oats, and fresh running water. They could not have been more happy."	myth		"cleverness, strength, cooperation"
33	The Cretan Bull	"His 7th labor was to capture the Cretan bull.

The Cretan bull had walked out of the sea. The bull found himself on the island of Crete. It was a beautiful island and a beautiful bull. The island sparkled with sunshine and happy people. The bull was huge, with silvery horns, and snow white skin. They seemed to fit.

There was a tribe of people on the lovely island of Crete. These people, the Minoans, had a favorite sport enjoyed by both boys and girls - bull jumping. Shortly after it arrived, the Cretan bull had been captured to use in the games. But the bull was not happy to be captured. The bull tossed and gored and trampled anyone who tried to leap over it. One day, it escaped.

To the Minoans, bulls were sacred. It was against their religion to kill a bull. They tried to recapture it, without harming it, but they did not succeed. The bull hid during the day. At night, it ripped destruction from one end of the island to the other.

When Hercules finally found the bull, who was hiding in the forest at the far end of the island, the bull threw its head down and pawed the earth. While the bull has its head down, and was not looking, Hercules quickly grabbed the bull by its horns and threw it to the ground. It made the bull dizzy for a minute. Before the bull could recover, Hercules had him tied tightly up with rope. Hercules carried the bull back to King Eury, much to the relief of the Minoan people of ancient Crete."	myth		"beauty, strength, cleverness"
34	The Girdle of Hippolyta	"For his 8th labor, King Eury told Hercules that he had to bring back the golden girdle of the Amazon queen. The Amazons were a tribe of fierce women. They were very warlike. Any men they met, they captured and kept as slaves.

This was not King Eury's idea actually. It was his daughter's. Hera had told her that wearing the girdle would make her as strong as an Amazon. That was pretty strong. King Eury's daughter wanted to wear the girdle. She wanted to be as strong as the Amazon queen. King Eurystheus' daughter did not care that this was an especially difficult mission, even for Hercules. She thought only of herself.

Hercules also thought this might be a difficult labor, but he was surprised. It was not difficult, not at first anyway. Hippolyta, the Amazon queen, had heard tales of the mighty Hercules. She knew Hercules would be a good friend to have in times of war. In the spirit of friendship, she willingly gave the girdle to Hercules to take back to King Eury's daughter.

As Hercules reached for the golden girdle, the Amazon women thought Hercules was reaching for their queen. They attacked him. During the fight, Hippolyta was accidentally killed by her own people. That started a big fight among the Amazon women. While they were fighting among themselves, Hercules managed to escape with the golden girdle.

35	The Cattle of Geryon	"His 9th labor was to capture the entire herd of the cattle of Geryon and present the herd to King Eury.

The Geryon was part man and part monster. He had two legs, the size of tree trunks. Three bodies grew from his waist, each with its own head and arms. He was very mean. And very strong. He owned a herd of red oxen that he kept on the island of Erythia. The island helped to protect his cattle from thieves. So did his two-headed dog.

Hercules had to fight the Geryon and his two-headed dog. Finally at last, when both lay quietly, either dead or exhausted (Hercules didn't actually care by then), Hercules herded the nervous red oxen aboard his ship and sailed for home."	myth		"perserverance, strength"
36	The Mares of King Diomedes	"His 10th labor was to capture the mares of King Diomedes.

The mares were horses. The mares were fed on human flesh. Hercules knew he needed help to capture these fearsome animals. Together with some good friends he had made on his travels, Hercules and his band of volunteers journeyed to the land of Thrace.

The mares were gentle. That surprised Hercules. He led one out of the stable. The other mares followed. Things were moving along nicely when Hercules was attacked by King Diomedes and the king's men. In the heat of battle, the king was thrown from his horse. His horse ate him.

When the king's men saw what had happened, they jumped from their horses and ran away. The mares ran after them. Hercules quickly gathered up the fleeing animals. With the help of his volunteers, Hercules muzzled the mares, then led them to King Eury."	myth		"cooperation, teamwork"
37	The Golden Apples of the Hesperides	"His 11th labor was bring the legendary golden apples of the Hesperides back to King Eury.

There was a rumor that the apples were hidden in the garden of the Hesperides. It was rumored that the apples gave immortal life to anyone who ate them, but hardly anyone believed the rumor. In fact, no mortal knew if the legendary golden apples really existed.

The Hesperides were magical creatures who lived a long way away. It took Hercules several months to reach the land of the Hesperides. When he finally reached the garden, he had to slay a dragon who was guarding the garden gate, before he could search for the apples.

The apples were poorly hidden. They were in plain sight, hanging on the apple tree in the center of the garden. It took Hercules no time at all to round them up. Hercules was tempted to take a bite and give himself immortal life. But he had heard another rumor. He had heard that the apples did not give immortal life, but rather, took immortal life away. That was not his goal at all.

Several months later, when he reached home, he gave the apples to King Eury. Eury quickly gave the apples to his wife. His wife returned the apples to the Hesperides with her apologies."	myth		"strength, perserverance"
38	The Capture of Cerberus	"His 12th and final labor was to descend into the underworld, and bring back Cerberus, the three-headed dog who guarded the gate to underworld, home of the powerful god, Hades.

Hercules knew how much Hades loved that fierce, bad tempered dog. Hercules asked Hades' permission to briefly capture Cerberus, and told him why. Hades agreed that Hercules could try, as long as he used no weapons and did not hurt poor Cerberus.

Hercules used his bare hands. He scooped all three heads up at once, and strangled Cerberus until he was unconscious. He gently carried the dog off to King Eury's. Cerberus began to regain consciousness as Hercules approached the king. The king scurried behind his royal throne.

Hercules explained he had to get the dog home right away. King Eury stuck his head out from behind his throne and quickly agreed that Hercules should leave immediately. Hercules promised to be right back.

After Hercules delivered Cerberus safely home, Hercules quickly returned to the palace, eager to be granted immortality. But Hera was nowhere to be found. Neither was King Eury."	myth		strength
39	King Midas and the Golden Touch	"Once upon a time, a long time ago in ancient Greece, there lived a king named Midas. King Midas loved three things more than anything else in the world - his little daughter, his rose garden, and gold. 
One night, while strolling through his rose garden, the king stumbled over a satyr. This satyr looked half-starved and very ill. King Midas brought the satyr into his castle. He made sure the satyr was washed and fed and tucked into bed for a good night's sleep. When the satyr woke up the next morning, his fever was gone. The king and the satyr had quite a nice chat over breakfast. King Midas was surprised to hear that the satyr belonged to the powerful god Dionysus, the god of wine and truth. That very day, the king personally took the satyr home in his very best chariot because the king had a very kind heart.
Dionysus told the king he would grant any one wish the king made to thank him for taking such good care of his friend. The king did not wish anything for his daughter because he had given her everything she wanted and a whole bunch more besides. He did not wish anything for his rose garden because everyone knew he grew the finest roses in all the world. That left gold. King Midas wished that everything he touched would turn to gold.
The king did not have much hope that his wish had been granted, because if it had been granted, his chariot would have turned to gold when he climbed aboard to go home, and it had not. Still, he was happy he had helped the satyr, and not just because the satyr was the servant of a god. When the king arrived back at his castle, he pulled out a chair to sit down at his table. The minute he touched it, the chair turned to gold. He touched the table. He touched a vase. As soon as he touched them, they turned to gold. King Midas raced though his castle. Everything he touched turned to gold! He was so happy. He shouted to his servants to cook him a feast in celebration!
His servants were very fond of King Midas. They knew he was foolish, but he was rather a dear. So they cooked and cooked and served him a feast. That's when the trouble started. Everything looked and smelled so good that King Midas did not wait for his daughter to show up for lunch. He reached out and grabbed a fistful of food. The food made quite a clatter when he dropped it back on the table in shock. It had turned to gold in his fist. He touched other food. Whatever he touched turned to gold. He tried leaning over and ripping a piece of meat with his teeth, but that did not help. The meat turned to gold in his mouth. The king's eyes filled with fear. He knew if he could not eat, he would starve. This was terrible. The king did not know what to do.
King Midas wandered sadly out to his rose garden. His little daughter was in the garden, picking roses. When she saw her father, she ran into his arms for a hug and turned to gold. King Midas hung his head and cried. As his tears fell on his precious roses they turned to gold, but the king did not care. He did not care about his roses or his gold or himself. Dionysus, hear my prayer, the king begged. Take my wish back! Please, take my wish back and save my daughter!
One last time, the king's wish was granted."	myth		"love, friendship, kindness, greed"
40	King Midas and the Donkey Ears	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, Pan, the god of shepherds, challenged Apollo to a musical duel. Pan insisted his flute of reeds could produce a more beautiful melody than Apollo's silly harp. The two agreed on a contest with judges. One of the judges was King Midas.
After hearing the two melodies, all but one of the judges chose Apollo as the winner. But one judge, King Midas, preferred Pan's tune.
Furious that anyone could prefer a reedy pipe to his musical lyre, Apollo cooed, ""I see the problem. It's your ears. They are too small to hear properly. Let me fix that for you.""
King Midas felt his ears quiver. His ears sprang out, and out, and turned into the large furry ears of an ass. King Midas was horrified. He grabbed his ears. ""Pan, help me!"" he cried. But Pan, with a quick nervous glance at Apollo, turned his back.
King Midas tried to hide his ears from his subjects by wearing a variety of huge hats, heavy helmets, and bulky scarves. The only person who saw his ears was his barber. King Midas made his barber promise he would never tell a soul.
His barber kept his word. But keeping such a huge secret to himself was driving him crazy. Finally, the barber went up a mountain and almost to the edge of a cliff. He dug a hole in the midst of some reeds. He looked about, to make sure no one was near. Then, he whispered into the hole, ""King Midas has the ears of an ass. King's aaaass ears! King's aaaass ears!"" Having gotten his secret off his chest, he felt much better. He returned home, sure that he had kept his word.
Unfortunately for King Midas, the barber had dug right into a piece of Echo. You've heard of Echo, right? Pieces of Echo were scattered all over the mountainous kingdom. In fact, pieces of Echo were scattered all over the world.
Although I suppose some people might think it was only the sound of the wind in the reeds, it was really a piece of Echo, whispering over and over, ""King's aaaass ears, king's aaaass ears"".
Sound travels well in the mountains, even whispers. It was not long before the entire kingdom knew the king's secret.

41	Story of the Just Plain Rotten King Tantalus	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a king named Tantalus. Everyone in his kingdom, including his wife and son, thought he was the most wonderful man in the world. Everyone believed he was a very good king, concerned about his people and their needs. But the truth was, King Tantalus was just plain rotten. He put up a good show, but he was evil.
King Tantalus could care less about his wife or his son or his people. The only thing King Tantalus cared about was himself. He thought his wife and his son and his people were stupid. He thought of himself as the smartest man in the world, much smarter than most of the gods, quite possibly smarter than all of them. Everyone in his kingdom believed there was no way to trick a god. Everyone knew the gods were all-knowing. Everyone, that is, except King Tantalus.
King Tantalus decided to trick the gods into doing something embarrassing, something they would never do, something they would never want anyone knowing about. That would prove he was smarter than any god.
King Tantalus knew there was one thing that the gods would never do. They would never eat human flesh. He was sure of it. Otherwise, there would not be any people left on earth!
King Tantalus decided to invite some of the gods to dinner. For the main course, he had his own son killed and made into a stew. If the gods were all-knowing, they would not eat it, and no harm done. But, if they did eat the stew, King Tantalus could reveal the ""secret"" ingredient, and blackmail the gods forever into giving King Tantalus everything he wanted. He knew the gods would never want a mere mortal to show the world how stupid they really were.
If gods refused to be blackmailed, he would threaten to tell his kingdom the gods had killed his son and made him into a stew. He knew the people would believe him. They always believed him. No one would leave offerings for the gods after that. King Tantalus was so delighted with his idea that he giggled and chuckled and laughed about it for days. The people were pleased to see their king so happy.
When the gods came to dinner, they knew right away what King Tantalus had done. First, they brought his son back to life, stronger and more handsome than ever before. Then, they punished King Tantalus by planting him firmly in the royal garden, next to an apple tree. The gods enchanted his feet so he could not move. They also enchanted the apple tree. Every time the hungry King Tantalus reached for an apple, the apple tree moved the branch just out of reach.
Word soon spread about the kingdom. Anyone who wanted to could peer over the garden wall and see King Tantalus stuck in the ground. The people were upset, no one more than his wife and son. As more and more stories of the rotten ugly things King Tantalus had done came to light, the people turned their backs on the royal gardens. No one came to the king's rescue.
King Tantalus slowly withered away."	myth		"deception, appearance, greed, hubris"
42	Echo and Narcissus	"Echo spotted the most beautiful young man. His name was Narcissus. Echo did something she thought she would never do - she fell in love. But Hera had taken most of her voice. All she do was echo sounds made by others. She could howl like a wolf, but only if a wolf had just howled. She could sing like a breeze through reeds, but only if the reeds sang first. How could she tell Narcissus that she loved him?
One day, she spotted Narcissus looking into a stream. He seemed enchanted by what he saw.  He did not know it was only the reflection of himself.
""Come to me,"" Narcissus begged, looking into the water.
""Come to me,"" Echo echoed eagerly.
Narcissus swung about. ""Who's there?"" he angrily demanded to know.
""Who's there,"" Echo echoed loudly.
""Stop that!"" Narcissus snapped.
""Stop that!"" Echo echoed.
""Let's meet,"" Narcissus said in a much softer voice that he had used so far.
""Let's meet!"" Echo echoed happily. She stepped out from behind a tree.
""Go away,"" Narcissus shouted at her.
""Go away,"" Echo echoed. Echo went sadly away.
Things did not go well for Narcissus after that. Narcissus returned to the stream again and again. He stared at the lovely young man he saw in the water, a young man who was only the reflection of himself.
Hidden from sight, Echo watched Narcissus as he lay by the stream. She repeated everything that Narcissus said. Narcissus ignored her. Day after day he lay by the stream, admiring his own reflection. He stopped eating. He stopped drinking. And finally, he died."	myth		"love, beauty, hubris"
43	Phaethon Son of Helios	"Phaethon was the son of Helios. Both father and son had curly golden hair and sparkling bright eyes. Both bragged about the other all the time.
Helios thought his son was the brightest and bravest kid in the world. Phaethon was equally proud of his Dad. His Dad's job was to bring out the sun each day. If the sun did not come up, the crops would die, and everyone would starve.
Each morning, the Hours, his Dad's servants, would harness four white horses to the most splendid golden chariot, the Sun Chariot.
Each morning, without fail, his Dad would leap aboard his golden Sun Chariot and begin his perilous journey across the sky. No matter how tired he was, his Dad always managed to reach every corner of the earth, to bring light and warmth to all the crops and all the people and everything on earth every single day.
Each evening, Helios would gather his beloved son and his equally beloved wife and daughters, and together they would watch the moon appear in the sky. The next morning, without fail, his Dad would leap again aboard his glowing chariot, and fly off to bring out the sun.
Phaethon bragged about his father to anyone who would listen, and even sometimes to those who were not listening at all. He bragged about the golden chariot. He bragged about the four wild horses. He bragged that one day his father would let him drive the chariot across the sky. Phaethon bragged so much that after a while his friends no longer believed him. They knew his Dad brought up the sun. But they did not believe his Dad would turn over such an important job to a mere boy, not even for one day.
First, his friends began to tease Phaethon. Then, after a while, his friends began to scatter away as Phaethon approached. They were tired of his incessant bragging.
Phaethon begged his father to let him drive. He knew he was ready. He knew he could handle the horses. He knew he could do the job without getting burnt. But mostly, he wanted to prove to his friends that his father trusted him enough to give him the reins. Finally, one evening, exhausted by his son's perpetual pleading, his father said yes."	myth		"perserverance, determination, love"
44	The Sun Chariot	"Phaethon eagerly climbed aboard the golden chariot. He took the reins tightly in his hands. The horses knew at once that the driver was not the capable Helios. They jerked and reared but Phaethon hung tightly to the reins.
Phaethon caught the sun up behind him on his first swing by, and began to drag the sun across the sky. Bursting with pride, he dipped down towards the earth. He wanted his friends to see him. But he flew too close. The hot sun began to dry up oceans and rivers and left deserts in their place.
When Phaethon realized his mistake, his eyes widened with panic. He yanked the reins to pull the horses higher in the sky. The horses reared in anger at being jerked so hard. The reins were ripped from Phaeton's hands. The runaway chariot tore across the sky, burning a trail behind it. The horses slowed finally to an amble, and turned towards home, eager for oats.
High on Mount Olympus, Zeus, the king of all the gods, was had been enjoying his breakfast. Something was wrong. It looked like Helios' horses were headed for home, but it was too early. Could Helios have fallen asleep? Zeus hurled a lightning bolt at the chariot as it flew by to wake Helios up. It hit the side of the chariot with incredible force. The chariot tilted. Someone dropped out of the chariot and fell into the Po River.
Zeus called for his magical horse, Pegasus. They quickly caught up with the sweating horses, who had slowed nearly to stop. Pegasus took the lead. Zeus grabbed the reins. Together, Zeus, Pegasus, and the four white horses finished dragging the sun around the earth. By the time they had tucked the sun in for the night, Zeus was in a raging temper. Zeus roared towards Ethiopia, where Helios kept his palace.
Once Zeus understood that the young boy, Phaethon, had been driving and had probably been what Zeus had noticed dropping out of the chariot into the Po River, Zeus sent Hermes to organize a search party. It was no use. Phaethon had disappeared. No one ever heard from him again.
As for Helios and his family, their sadness was great. Some say his daughters cried so much that Zeus, as punishment for Helios' bad judgment, changed his daughters into the poplar trees that lined the Po River. Some insist it's only the wind, but others say you can still hear them crying even today.
Helios continued to bring out the sun, but his heart wasn't it. He flew too high and let clouds cover the earth. The earth suffered gloomy day after gloomy day. He flew too low, and burned rivers down to creeks.
Finally, Zeus had to intercede. He made Helios give up his job, the job that had made him so proud, and gave the job of bringing out the sun each day to his own son, Apollo. "	myth		"atonement, naivety"
45	"Why Anansi Has
Eight Thin Legs"	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a spider named Anansi. Anansi's wife was a very good cook. But always, Anansi loved to taste the food that others in the village made for themselves and for their families.
One day, he stopped by Rabbit's house. Rabbit was his good friend.
""There are greens in your pot,"" cried Anansi excitedly. Anansi loved greens.
""They are not quite done,"" said Rabbit. ""But they will be soon. Stay and eat with me.""
""I would love to, Rabbit, but I have some things to do,"" Anansi said hurriedly. If he waited at Rabbit's house, Rabbit would certainly give him jobs to do. ""I know,"" said Anansi. ""I'll spin a web. I'll tie one end around my leg and one end to your pot. When the greens are done, tug on the web, and I'll come running!""
Rabbit thought that was a great idea. And so it was done.
""I smell beans,"" Anansi sniffed excitedly as he ambled along. ""Delicious beans, cooking in a pot.""
""Come eat our beans with us,"" cried the monkeys. ""They are almost done.""
""I would love to Father Monkey,"" said Anansi. And again, Anansi suggested he spin a web, with one end tied around his leg, and one end tied to the big bean pot.
Father Monkey thought that was a great idea. All his children thought so, too. And so it was done.
""I smell sweet potatoes,"" Anansi sniffed happily as he ambled along. ""Sweet potatoes and honey, I do believe!""
""Anansi,"" called his friend Hog. ""My pot is full of sweet potatoes and honey! Come share my food with me.""
""I would love to,"" said Anansi. And again, Anansi suggested he spin a web, with one end tied around his leg, and one end tied to the sweet potato pot.
His friend Hog thought that was a great idea. And so it was done.
By the time Anansi arrived at the river, he had one web tied to each of his eight legs.
""This was a wonderful idea,"" Anansi told himself proudly. ""I wonder whose pot will be ready first?""
Just then, Anansi felt a tug at his leg. ""Ah,"" said Anansi. ""That is the web string tied to Rabbit's greens."" He felt another. And another. Anansi was pulled three ways at once.
""Oh dear,"" said Anansi as he felt the fourth web string pull.
Just then, he felt the fifth web string tug. And the sixth. And the seventh. And the eighth. Anansi was pulled this way and that way, as everyone pulled on the web strings at once. His legs were pulled thinner and thinner. Anansi rolled and tugged himself into the river. When all the webs had washed away, Anansi pulled himself painfully up on shore.
""Oh my, oh my,"" sighed Anansi. ""Perhaps that was not such a good idea after all.""
To this day, Anansi the Spider has eight very thin legs. And he never got any food that day at all."	myth		"sharing, naivety"
46	The Lion's Whisker	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a young husband and wife in a small village in Africa. For some time now, the husband had not been happy with his marriage. He began to come home late from working in the fields. His wife thought he was the most wonderful man. But she was unhappy, too. His behavior was making her miserable.
Finally, she went to the village elder. The elder was sad to hear her marriage was not a happy one. He had married them only two years before. At the time, he was sure that the marriage would be a good one.
""Of course I will end your marriage if that is what you want,"" he told the young wife, after listening patiently for a while. ""You will be free to marry again. But is that really what you want?""
""I want my husband to be loving,"" she said. ""I want to be loving. We are both miserable.""
""I think I can help you,"" the elder said slowly. ""I can prepare a secret potion that will change your husband into a loving man.""
""Prepare this magic potion at once!"" the young wife cried out excitedly.
""I could make it,"" he said sadly. ""But I am missing an important ingredient. I am too old to get this ingredient for you. You must bring it to me.""
""What do you need?"" the young wife asked eagerly. ""I'll bring it today.""
""I need a single whisker taken from a living lion to make the potion work.""
Her eyes widened in alarm. She bit her bottom lip. She straightened her shoulders. ""I'll get it for you,"" she nodded.
The next morning, the young wife carried a huge piece of raw meat down to the river where lions sometimes came to drink. She hid behind a tree and waited. After waiting many hours, a lion ambled down to the river to have a drink. He sniffed at the raw meat. In three bites, the meat was gone. He raised his mighty head. He knew she there. The young wife held her breath. The mighty lion moved slowly back into the forest and disappeared.
The next day, the young wife came again. This time, the lion appeared quite quickly. This continued for many days. Days became weeks. Each day, the woman crept from her hiding place behind the tree, moving closer and closer to the lion.
At the end of four weeks, she moved quietly next to the lion and sat silently while he ate. Her hand shaking, she reached slowly out and pulled a whisker from his chin. Holding per prize firmly in one hand, she sat frozen until the lion had disappeared back into the forest.
She ran to the elder, waving her whisker. ""I have it,"" she shouted. ""I have it!""
The elder was in awe when he heard her story. ""You do not need magic to change your husband back into the loving man he once was. You are brave enough to pull a whisker from the chin of a living lion. It took cleverness and bravery to do what you have done. Can you not use that same patience and courage and wit with your husband?
""But the potion,"" the young wife said eagerly. ""Would not that work as well?""
""Perhaps,"" the elder told her. ""But it would not last. Trust me, my child. Show your husband each day that you love him. Share his problems. Make him feel welcome. Make him feel wanted and needed. Give him time to change and see what happens.""
The young wife went home and followed the elder's advice. Slowly, her husband began to return from the fields with the other men of the village. He began to look glad to see her. Within a year, their life was a happy one.

47	Wise Owl	"There is an old saying, ""wise as an owl"".  People are always saying that, but the truth is, owls were not always wise.
Once upon a time, a long time ago, the Everything-Maker was very busy, making all the animals and all the plants and all the rocks and caverns and everything else that covered the earth.
Owl had not yet been made. He had been given a voice. And two eyes. And a head and a body and strong wings. Owl was waiting his turn to be formed. ""I want a long neck like Swan,"" Owl told the Everything-Maker. ""I want red feathers like Cardinal and a beak like Hawk.""
""Yes, yes,"" mumbled the Everything-Maker. ""Whatever you want. But you must wait your turn."" The Everything-Maker looked sharply at Owl. ""Your eyes are open again. You know that no one is allowed to watch me work. Turn around and close your eyes. I have no time for you now. I am busy creating Rabbit.""
The Everything-Maker turned his attention back to Rabbit who was shaking with nervousness. ""And what do you want, little rabbit?"" the Everything-Maker asked encouragingly.
""Long legs and ears,"" Rabbit spoke softly. ""And fangs. Could I possibly have a fang or two? And claws. I would dearly love to have claws!""
The Everything-Maker smiled. ""I think we could manage some claws and fangs."" He smoothed Rabbit's long legs and ears.
""Silly Rabbit!"" Owl hooted loudly. ""Why don't you ask for something useful, like wisdom?""
""This is your last warning, Owl. Be quiet and wait your turn.""
Owl twisted around and glared at the Everything-Maker. ""You have to do it,"" he hooted. ""You have to give us what we ask. I demand wisdom!""
""I warned you, Owl!"" shouted the Everything-Maker. He shoved Owl's head down into his body, which made Owl's neck disappear. He gave Owl a shake, which made Owl's eyes widen in fright. He pulled Owl's ears until they stuck out from his head.
The Everything-Maker snapped his fingers. ""I have made your ears big, the better to listen. I have made your eyes big, the better to see. I have made your neck short, the better to hold up your head. I have packed your head with wisdom, as you have asked. Now, use your wisdom and fly away before you lose what I have given.""
Owl was no longer a fool. He flew quickly away, pouting and hooting.
The Everything-Maker turned back to Rabbit, smiling gently. ""Claws,"" he reminded himself. But Rabbit was gone. Rabbit had hopped hurriedly away, too afraid of the Everything-Maker to stay for his fangs and claws.
As for Owl, Owl knew if he angered the Everything-Maker again, he would lose all that he had gained. Even today, Owl only comes out at night, when the Everything-Maker is fast asleep."	myth		"appearance, patience, greed, naivety"
48	Clever Coyote	"Once upon a time, a long ago, a horrible monster stole all the buffalo from the plains and put them in his mountain hideout.
""There,"" beamed the monster. ""I have enough food to last forever.""
Coyote, a wild dog, called all the people and all the animals together in a great meeting to figure out what they could do. No one had an idea. They were too afraid of the monster to think at all.
""I scouted the monster,"" Coyote spoke up. ""He lives with a very small boy.""
""We cannot hurt a child,"" said one of the people. ""Not even to get back our buffalo.""
""That is understood,"" Coyote nodded. ""But I was thinking .... a small boy must be very lonely with no one love except a horrible monster. I think we should give him a pet to love. When the chance arises, the pet we send can set the buffalo free.""
All the people and all the animals thought that was a marvelous idea.
First, they sent Mouse to win the heart of the small boy. The boy liked Mouse and took him home. But the monster told the boy to send Mouse away. Next, the people sent Killdeer, a bird. But the bird fared no better.
Coyote called another meeting. ""I think,"" Coyote told all the people and all the animals, ""that I must go myself.""
That very day, Coyote set out for the monster's lair. When the boy saw Coyote, his eyes brightened. The boy loved Coyote immediately and took him home. The monster was very angry. ""Get that mangy dog out of here before I eat you both!""
The boy and Coyote ran out of the lair. The boy sat down. He tried not to cry, but a tear ran down one cheek. Coyote licked it away.
""Poor dog,"" sighed the boy. ""I bet you're hungry.""
Coyote put back his head and howled. That is the sound Coyote makes to comfort you.
The buffalo heard Coyote's cry. It frightened them. They began shuffling and stamping their feet the way buffalo do when they are nervous.
The more the boy cried, and the more Coyote howled to make him feel better, the more frightened the buffalo became. One buffalo became so afraid that he began to run. The other buffalo ran after him. They ran and ran until they had scattered all over the plains. The monster ran after the buffalo.
While the monster was gone, Coyote took the small boy to live with the people.
The monster hunted and hunted, but the buffalo had scattered without a trace. Late that night, when the monster returned to his lair, young warriors were waiting. They killed the monster, much to the relief of one small boy and all of the people and all of the animals.
That is why the elders say it is Coyote to whom we owe the buffalo. Even today, the people still give thanks to clever Coyote. If it had not been for the smart head and warm heart of one little dog, that horrible monster would have kept all the buffalo for himself forever."	myth		"cleverness, teamwork, cooperation"
49	"Child of Water
and Little Blue Rock"	"Once upon a time, four monsters lived on the earth. They were horrible monsters. They loved to catch the People and eat them. This did not make them very popular with the People. Whenever the monsters approached, all the People ran away.
One night, a monster stomped up to the wickiup of Child of Water and his mother. Before his mother could stop him, Child of Water challenged the monster to a contest.
""Here are the rules,"" said Child of Water. He carefully explained that he would be on one side and the monster would be on the other. Both sides would have a chance to shoot four arrows at each other, at the same time. Whichever killed the other first would get all the food. ""Do you accept these rules and promise to obey them?"" chanted Child of Water, in the way of the people. Child of Water was only a very small boy. But he knew the chant was binding. It was a promise that must be kept.
""I'll play your silly game,"" laughed the monster. ""First I'll shoot you full of arrows. Then I'll eat you, your mother, and all your food!"" Just thinking about this satisfying treat had the monster smacking his lips hungrily.
As both fighters took their positions, Child of Water leaned down and picked up a turquoise blue rock. The rock was a gift from the gods, a thing of protection. But Child of Water did not know that. While he was looking at his rock, the monster quickly shot four arrows at Child of Water. This was against the rules, but the monster did not care. Much to his surprise, all the monster's arrows missed Child of Water. Quickly, before the monster could do anything else against the rules, Child of Water shot an arrow at the monster. The arrow pierced the monster's heart and killed him dead.
By then, everyone had gathered around. It was obvious that the Devil Dancers were among them. What a noise they made that night rejoicing!
The next day, Child of Water's mother bore a hole in that lucky blue rock. She strung it into a necklace. Ever after, Child of Water wore the blue rock around his neck for love and luck. Over time, Child of Water found many blue rocks. He made a wonderful necklace for his mother, to keep her safe as well.
As time went on, and as Child of Water grew taller, each monster came to challenge him. Each time, wearing his lucky blue rock, each monster's arrows missed Child of Water. But Child of Water's arrows killed each monster, every time, until all the monsters were gone.
As all Apache children know, it is a wise thing to hunt for turquoise blue rocks. If you find one, you too might find yourself some luck."	myth		"confidence, strength"
50	"Andromeda, Perseus, and the sea god, Poseidon"	"Andromeda was the daughter of a king, but she was not spoiled at all. Andromeda was as kind as she was beautiful. She was even more beautiful than her mother, the lovely Cassiopeia. Andromeda lived in a city by the sea. She was very happy. Everything was going along swimmingly until one day Andromeda's mother went too far with her boasting.
Her mother boasted about Andromeda all the time. Her mother insisted she was the most beautiful child ever born, except for Aphrodite, of course. One day, she boasted that Andromeda was more beautiful than any of the gods' daughters.
The trouble started when someone told the Nereids what she had boasted. The Nereids were the daughters of the sea god, Poseidon. Poseidon told his daughters all the time that they were more beautiful than seashells. Who could possibly be more beautiful than seashells? They whined to their father about it, and whined and whined until Poseidon, in a fit of rage, flooded the city by the sea, and sent a huge sea serpent to devour the entire population, thinking that would certainly shut his daughters up.
The people were terrified. The flood had caused great discomfort. Even after the flood waters receded, the monster kept nipping at people.
The king asked a local oracle what he could do to put a stop to things. The oracle told him he had to sacrifice his beloved daughter, Andromeda, if he wanted to save his city. It saddened him greatly, but the king ordered his daughter to be chained to a tree on a cliff that overlooked the sea.
That day, the hero Perseus was out adventuring. He sailed past just as the king's servants were chaining the terrified Andromeda to a tree at the edge of a cliff. Perseus fell in love immediately. As soon as the servants left, Perseus rescued Andromeda, using his magic sickle to cut the chains.
Just then, the giant sea serpent reared its ugly head and reached for Andromeda. Andromeda screamed. Perseus, who was still holding his magic sickle, chopped off the serpent's head. 
Naturally, after that, Andromeda loved Perseus as much as he loved her. Perseus wanted her to sail away with him immediately. But Andromeda was insistent that he first ask her father's permission to marry him. She would not feel right about marrying anyone without it.
Perseus offered the king a deal. If the king would let him marry his daughter, Perseus promised to chop off the sea monster's head. The king thought it a very good joke when he heard that Perseus had already killed the monster. When he heard that Perseus' mother was a princess in the famous and rich city-state of Argos, he was even more pleased. When he heard that Perseus' was half god, and his father was the mighty Zeus, the king of all the gods, the king gladly agreed to the wedding.
After the wedding festivities, Perseus sailed away with Andromeda. They headed for his home in the city-state of Argos, where they lived happily ever after."	myth		"love, beauty, strength, confidence"
51	Icarus and Daedalus	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a talented artist. His name was Daedalus. He used his art to make buildings and temples. He was probably the finest architect of his time.
King Minos invited Daedalus to the lovely island of Crete. The king wanted Daedalus to build a maze, a Labyrinth, as a home for the king's beloved pet, the Minotaur. 
Daedalus brought his young son Icarus with him. He was sure the child would enjoy swimming and playing with the other children on the island. Both Daedalus and Icarus were happy they had come. King Minos was happy with his maze. It was peaceful and pleasant on the island. Daedalus was in no hurry to leave.
One day, a group of Greek children sailed to the island. The next day, they sailed safely away, taking with them the king's lovely daughter, and leaving behind them one dead Minotaur.
King Minos was beside himself with grief. He did not believe anyone could have entered the maze and escape alive without help from someone, most probably help from the man who had designed the maze in the first place. King Minos punished the innocent Daedalus by keeping Daedalus and his young son Icarus prisoners on the island of Crete.
Daedalus tried to think of ways to escape. One day, Daedalus noticed birds flying overhead. It gave him an idea. Wings. He needed wings. Daedalus began to gather all the bird feathers he could find. He glued them together with wax. When two pairs of wings were ready, he warned his young son not to fly too close to the sun or the wax would melt.
Daedalus fastened the wings to their arms. They flapped their wings and took to the sky. They left the island of Crete far behind them. Water sparkled beneath them as far as they could see. The sky was blue. The breeze was brisk, more than enough to keep them in the air. It was glorious!
Icarus flew higher and higher. He flew so high that before he knew what was happening, the sun had begun to melt the wax on his wings. Icarus felt himself falling. He flapped his arms faster and faster. But it was no use. Poor Icarus plunged into the water and drowned."	myth		"hubris, naivety"
52	The Gift of Fire	"From the very first, humans had trouble with the gods. Most gods thought of humans as toys. But some gods found themselves interested in humans. Some gods even made friends with the humans. One of those gods was named Prometheus.
The first people created by the gods lived happily together. They thought the gods were wonderful. But their children were not as grateful or as content. The children argued among themselves, and sometimes even argued with the gods.
Zeus was very disappointed at mankind. He decided he was not going to give mankind a most important tool - fire! Without fire, humans were not going to last very long.
Prometheus felt sorry for his human friends. Fire was important for many things - like heat and cooking, and hundreds of others. Prometheus stole a lightning bolt from Zeus and gave it to mankind. That's when man discovered fire.
Zeus was furious. He ordered Prometheus chained to a rock as punishment for stealing his lightning bolt, and for going behind his back to help the humans. To make Prometheus even more miserable, Zeus sent storms to beat angry waves against Prometheus, helplessly chained to his rock. Zeus made the sun shine really brightly now and then to burn his skin. Zeus even sent an eagle to nibble at poor Prometheus' body. It was quite a punishment for a god who had only tried to help mankind. But he had defied Zeus, and that was what made Zeus so angry.
It was Hercules who finally released the helpless god from his chains. By the time Hercules saved him, nearly a thousand years had passed. That's probably not a lot of time if you happen to be immortal. But humans had changed a great deal over 1000 years. By then, Zeus found humans quite entertaining. Zeus no longer cared if anyone rescued Prometheus or not."	myth		"sharing, kindness, naivety"
53	Pandora's Box	"Once up a time, a long time ago, there were two brothers named Epimetheus and Prometheus. They were good gods. They had good hearts. They were good friends.
One day, Prometheus got in trouble with Zeus. Angry over something or other, Zeus had declared that man did not deserve fire. Because he had a kind heart, and he knew how much man needed fire for food and warmth, Prometheus gave man the secret of fire even though Zeus had told all the gods not to do that. Zeus was furious that his order had been ignored. As punishment, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock for many years.
But that was not enough punishment, not for Zeus. Once Prometheus was chained to a rock, Zeus went after Prometheus' brother, the gentle, kind-hearted Epimetheus. Zeus did not chain Epimetheus to a rock. Zeus had a sneakier punishment in mind.
First, Zeus ordered the gods' handyman, the maker of things - Hephaestus - to make Zeus a daughter. Hephaestus made a woman out of clay, a beautiful woman. He brought her to life, and then brought her to Zeus. Zeus named his lovely new daughter Pandora.
Zeus knew that Epimetheus was lonely. Zeus told Epimetheus that his brother, Hephaestus, had to be punished and that's why he was chained to a rock, but he felt sorry that this punishment left Epimetheus without the company of his brother. That's why Zeus had decided to give Pandora in marriage to Epimetheus. It was not the truth of course, but then nearly everyone in the ancient Greek world knew better than to believe the mighty Zeus. 
Epimetheus was kind-hearted and gentle and thoughtful, but he was no fool. He knew Zeus was up to something. But he loved Pandora at first sight.
Zeus gave the newlyweds a gift. Some say it was a jar. Some say it was a box. Whatever it was, it was locked. It came with a note. The note said: ""DO NOT OPEN."" Attached to the note was a key. It was all very curious.
You can guess what happened next. It was Pandora whose curiosity got the better of her. One day, she used the key to open the box. As she raised the lid, out flew all the bad things in the world today - envy, sickness, hate, disease. Pandora slammed the lid closed, but it was too late.
Epimetheus heard her weeping. He came running. Pandora opened the lid to show him it was empty. Quickly, before she could slam the lid shut, one tiny bug flew out. He gave Pandora a big buggy smile in thanks for his freedom and flew away. That tiny bug was named Hope. And Hope made all the difference in the world."	myth		"love, beauty, naivety, deception"
54	Zeus and the Great Flood	"Pandora's box had caused quite a few problems. Zeus was horrified at what had happened. After the box was opened, Zeus looked down on earth from Mount Olympus. He saw fights and riots and wars and murders. Even though it was Zeus himself who had loaded Pandora's box with all kinds of terrible things, Zeus was determined to punish mankind for the terrible behavior he saw.
He decided man had to go. Man was a mistake. Zeus ordered the waters to rise and flood the earth. Everyone drowned except two people. One was King Deucalion, who was considered the most honest man on earth. The other was the king's wife, Pyrrha.
Some say the god Prometheus warned King Deucalion that a flood was coming. This was the same Prometheus who had given mankind the gift of fire. Not only did Prometheus have a kind heart, but King Deucalion was Prometheus' son. He knew how much his son loved his mortal wife.
Prometheus told his son to build a sturdy boat and stock it well. His son knew that Prometheus could see into the future. Prometheus told his son that when the waters receded, he must throw the bones of the Great Mother over his shoulder and to have his son's wife do the same.
King Deucalion loved his father. He trusted his father. He did not always understand all of his father's instructions, but he certainly could build a sturdy boat.
Just as his father predicted, the flood came. King Deucalion and Pyrrha sailed away on their boat for 9 days and 9 nights. When the waters receded, the boat settled down on the tallest peak in Greece, at the very tip top of Mount Parnassus.
King Deucalion had listened carefully to his father's directions. They had not made much sense to him, but he had listened. The king mumbled to himself, ""The earth is the Great Mother. Since the earth is the Great Mother of humans, her bones must be ...... stones!""
King Deucalion picked up some stones and threw them over his shoulder. Magically, the stones became men! Pyrrha did the same. Her stones became women. Many stones later, the human race had started again."	myth		"perserverance, cooperation, foresight"
55	"Aphrodite, Goddess of Love and Beauty"	"The ancient Greek goddess, Aphrodite, showed up one day, thousands of years ago, and began appearing in ancient Greek myths, the myths told by the ancient Greek storytellers. According to the stories that sprang up about her, she was as vain as she was beautiful, and she was very beautiful. Zeus was delighted to claim her as his daughter. It was Zeus' habit to give his children titles and jobs. He gave Aphrodite the title of Goddess of Love and Beauty, and the job of spreading love and beauty everywhere.
Aphrodite had a son, Eros (known as Cupid in Roman mythology) whom she loved dearly. She had a husband, the handyman to the gods, Hephaestus, whom she tolerated. She even got along with Hera, Queen of all the Greek gods, most of the time. She worked very hard at the job Zeus had given her as the goddess of love and beauty.
Aphrodite tried to be nice to everyone, usually, and tried to spread love and beauty everywhere she went. But unfortunately, her plans for people (and gods and goddesses) did not always work out the way she thought they would, which caused no end of trouble. As Aphrodite often insisted, the things that went wrong were not really her fault. Not really."	myth		"appearance, beauty, love"
56	The Trojan Horse	"Once upon a time, there was an ancient city on the coast of Turkey named Troy. It was located across the Aegean Sea from the Greek city-state of Sparta. When the king of Sparta heard that his wife, the beautiful Helen, had been kidnapped by a prince of Troy, he called on the other Greek city-states to help him get her back. His call was answered. A thousand Greek ships set sail for Troy.
The city of Troy was protected by a high wall built around the city. Some parts of the wall were 20 feet high! There were gates in the wall to let people in and out but it provided great defense for the people of Troy. It gave the Trojan warriors a relatively safe place to stand, while they rained arrows down on the people below, who were trying to break into the city.
At the time of this story, Greek warriors had been trying to breach the wall around Troy for about ten years. The Greeks could not find a way in, and the Trojans did not seem able to drive the Greeks away.
Things looked pretty hopeless until Odysseus, a famous ancient Greek general, thought of a trick. It was the custom back then to leave a peace offering behind to admit defeat. Odysseus suggested the Greeks build a huge, heavy, beautiful wooden horse, and leave it outside the gates of Troy. Then, the entire Greek army would pretend to leave, as if they were headed for home. But it was a trick. The horse would be hollow. Thirty men would be hiding inside. The very best Greek artists got busy carving the giant wooden horse, adding great detail, because everything in the Greek world had to be as beautiful as possible.
When it was done, the Greek warriors pretended to sail away, leaving the horse behind. The people of Troy rushed outside, cheering their victory! They dragged the heavy horse inside the city gates and put it on display, which is just what the Greek general thought they would do - gloat."	myth		cleverness
57	How It All Started	" Hercules had had a lot of fun solving the 12 Labors, but he wasn't paid for his work. Hercules thought and thought and came up with one of his very best ideas. He would open a detective agency - the Hercules Detective Agency - to help the Greek people fix their problems, especially problems the gods had thrust upon them. And he would charge a small fee of food or blankets or something else that he needed. That would solve everything! Hercules was very pleased with himself for thinking of such a brilliant solution.

The first thing he did was to create a rather large sign. He hung it on the outside wall of his hut. The sign said: The Hercules Detective Agency, Founded to Help the Greek People, No Problem Too Large or Too Small, Reasonable Fees, Proprietor Hercules, also known as Heracles, also known as Herc.

After admiring his sign for a considerable amount of time, Hercules began to realize that although his sign was very nice, he needed something bigger. Hercules knew he was famous. Just about everyone in ancient Greece knew he had solved the 12 Labors. But that was in the past. How to get the word out that he was open for business in the present? Once again, Hercules thought and thought, but this time no brilliant solution occurred to him. He was just about ready to give up for the night and go to sleep, hoping he might dream a solution, when there was a knock on the door of his hut.

""Herc! Open up! I need your help!"" shouted a harmless looking individual with tousled hair and very worried eyes.

That's how the Hercules Detective Agency found its first client, case file: The Misunderstood Minotaur"	historical		"sharing, cooperation"
58	The Misunderstood Minotaur	"""Herc! Open up! I need your help!"" shouted a harmless looking individual with tousled hair and very worried eyes.
""Prince Theseus!"" Hercules stared at the young man with amazement. ""What brings you to my door?""
""Hercules, I know you can solve anything. Look what you did to the Stymphalian Birds, and the Cretan Bull, and oh my - the Lernaean Hydra! Everyone in Greece knows how clever you are, and how courageous.""
Hercules had turned rather red with embarrassment. Just the same, he was beginning to think the young prince was a rather good fellow. He would be glad to help him. For a small fee, of course.
""I need you to kill the dreaded Cretean Minotaur!"" Theseus blurted. ""Before he can eat the children of Athens!""
""Your highness. Someone has been pulling your leg. There is no such monster as the Cretean Minotaur.""
""But Herc, there is! It's a horrible monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man. My father made a deal,"" Theseus sadly explained. ""My father never expected King Minos to keep his word, but he did. And now it's time to send the children of Athens to Crete, to be eaten by the dreaded Minotaur.""
Hercules knew the importance of keeping your word. He knew that a deal was a deal. He was also quite sure that it was wrong to send small children to be eaten by a monster.
The answer came to Hercules, just like that. He knew what had to be done. It was the only way. ""You have to rescue the Minotaur.""
""WHAT!"" shrieked Prince Theseus.
""Think about it, your highness. How would you like to spend your life in the middle of an impossible to escape maze, with no friends, and nothing to do? I bet that poor Minotaur has tried to get out before. He'll know a lot of ways that won't work.""
""But, Herc!""
 Hercules laughed. ""I don't expect you to rescue the Minotaur, your highness. I expect you to hire me to do it. I need the money and you need to save the children of Athens. I'll take the case!""
""Thank you, Hercules,"" the young king mumbled. ""I'm sure you'll think of a way,"" he added dismally.
""I already have,"" Hercules assured the young prince. ""Listen up. Here's what we're going to do."""	historical		"cooperation, confidence"
59	The Misunderstood Minotaur - Part 2	"It was easy to reach the center of the maze. Hercules simply followed the bellowing. There, surprisingly, he made a friend. The Minotaur was very excited to hear that Hercules was there to rescue him. They followed the string back to the prince and the children waiting nervously inside the door.
""The villagers are going to kill me,"" the Minotaur worried.
""Nah,"" Hercules grinned. ""We have an inside man, so to speak."" He turned to Theseus and the children. ""Everybody ready?"" There were nods all around. ""You know what to do?"" More nods, excited ones this time. ""Then Prince Theseus, knock on the door and get us out of here!""
The Minotaur hid out of sight, around the corner, as Theseus knocked on the door.
Princess Ariadne was waiting. She opened the door. It helped that Princess Ariadne was not paying attention. She did not like children much, and she was eager to leave the island forever. She had sent the guards away, as Hercules as sure she would. The children surrounded the Minotaur who had joined them. They tried to hide him entirely, but there was not much they could do about his horns. Those stuck up rather obviously, but the princess did not notice. Led by Princess Ariadne, followed by the prince, followed by Hercules, followed by the children of Athens and one terrified Minotaur, they ran to their ship. The children hid the Minotaur under some waiting blankets. Princess Ariadne did not even notice when the sixth Athenian boy, who had been left behind to guard the ship, joined them.
The rest of the tale, as released to the public, was nearly accurate. On the way home, they did stop for supplies on the tiny island of Naxos. Princess Ariadne did insist on coming ashore. Bored, the princess did fall asleep, snoring softly. Theseus did sail away, carrying with him one very happy Minotaur, one very proud Hercules, and some very noisy children. It was Hercules who suggested they leave the sleeping princess behind, so that the entire population of the tiny island of Naxos could admire her beauty. Theseus and all the children agreed. That's what they did. They sailed away and left the beautiful princess behind, sleeping.
After all, a deal is a deal.
As for Hercules, he was paid a royal sum for saving the children of Athens. To this day, until just now, nobody in Greece, except for Prince Theseus and the children and the Minotaur, of course, knew what Hercules had done.
As for the Minotaur, Hercules built a home for the misunderstood Minotaur behind his hut. They remained friends all their lives and shared many exciting adventures. As Hercules soon learned, it never hurts to have a Minotaur around when facing dangerous monsters."	historical		"cooperation, friendship, teamwork, happiness, cleverness, kindness"
60	Poseidon and Athena	"Off Hercules went to ask his aunt Hestia, goddess of hearth and home, to see if she knew anything about it.
Hestia laughed when Hercules asked her. ""Athena and Poseidon? Yes, they did have a competition. I love my brother, but he can be such an idiot!"" She laughed again. ""Both Athena and Poseidon spotted a little coastal village at the same time. They both wanted to claim this little coastal village. Poseidon decided the townspeople should choose which god they wanted, Athena or himself. Of course he assumed it would be himself.""
""Oh my,"" Hercules shook his head.
""Exactly. The people did not want to choose. Your sister Athena, the goddess of wisdom, daughter of Zeus, understood their worry. To solve things, she offered Poseidon a competition. Both gods would give the town a gift. The townspeople could decide which gift was the more useful. Whichever gift they picked, that god won. Poseidon took the deal. He slapped that specter of his against the against the side of the mountain. A stream appeared. The people were excited. A source of fresh water is so important!""
""That was clever,"" admired Hercules.
""He can be clever,"" Hestia agreed. ""He can also be an idiot. When the townspeople tried to drink the water, they discovered it was not fresh water. It was salt water! Before Poseidon could produce something better, Athena waved her arm and an olive tree appeared. The people nibbled at the olives. They were delicious! But theirs was a coastal village. The people could not risk angering the moody Lord of the Sea. As it turned out, they did not have to choose. Poseidon chose for them. Poseidon proclaimed his niece the winner, and graciously gave her the village. The townspeople were so grateful that they named their village after her, which is how the city-state of Athens got its name.""
""Athens! That must have been a long time ago,"" Hercules said, sounding disappointed. ""And she only gave them one olive tree.""
""One was enough. She didn't need any more. She was competing against a spring of salt water,"" Hestia laughed.
 Hercules slumped. ""It's a great story, Aunt Hestia. But it's not what I'm looking for.""
""What are you looking for?"""	historical		"cleverness, sharing, kindness"
61	The Missing Olive Tree	"A farmer knocked on Hercules' door. ""Someone has stolen my olive trees!""
""An interesting case at last,"" thought Hercules. He sent the farmer home with a promise that he would investigate it. And investigate it he did. 
Off Hercules went to ask his aunt Hestia, goddess of hearth and home, to see if she knew anything about it.
Hestia laughed when Hercules asked her. She said, ""What are you looking for?""
""I'm looking for a whole grove of olive trees that were stolen from a farmer recently.""
""A whole grove? Well, Athena and Dionysus had a competition a few days ago. There's a new little town up north that caught their eye at the same time. Athena challenged Dionysus to a competition, just as did with her uncle Poseidon. I thought for sure Dionysus would win. He gave the town a field of grape vines. But Athena gave the town a grove of olive trees. The townspeople chose Athena. Your sister told me Dionysus left in a huff and took his vines with him.""
""Thank you, Aunt Hestia! I knew you'd know. You keep such a close, caring eye on the women of Greece and what they need and what their kitchens need. No wonder they love you.""
Hestia handed Hercules a fresh from the oven apple pie. ""I'm glad I could help,"" she reached up and kissed his cheek. ""Behave now.""
Hercules knew he could not take the olive grove away from a growing village. But he could give the farmer something else nearly as good.
His next stop was the home of Dionysus. Dionysus owned Hercules a couple of favors. To sweeten the deal, Hercules brought Hestia's pie with him to the door, willing to share, thinking it might help him talk Dionysus, the god of wine, into giving the farmer the grape vines Dionysus had made, but not used, to replace the farmer's missing olive trees.
""I'll do it,"" agreed Dionysus. ""It will cost you though - one whole apple pie. Provided Aunt Hestia made it and not you.""
The farmer was thrilled. He promised Hercules a barrel or two of delicious red wine, once the vines bore fruit.
Although Hercules did not get to eat his apple pie and had to wait to drink his barrels of wine, he did solve the case.
Hercules named it The Case of the Missing Olive Trees and filed it away with a growing stack of Case Files from the Hercules Detective Agency."	mystery		"sharing, cooperation, cleverness"
62	Loawnu the Wise Woman	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, in Xia times, there was a young, wise woman named Loawnu. She was very young to be the village wise woman. Still, the people in the village trusted her. If you had a problem, everyone knew you took it to Loawnu.

One day, the sky overhead darkened. The wind picked up and blew wildly. Several young children ran up the hill to Loawnu's home, dragging a basket behind them. The basket was overflowing with the remains of blue flowers that had been yanked by the wind from the earth.

""The sky has fallen,"" they screamed at Loawnu. ""The sky has fallen!""

The children knew this was a very bad time for this to happen. Theirs was the village selected by many others to host this year's Spring Festival. It was quite an honor. The village would be disgraced without a sky. The children were too young to find husbands and wives at the Festival. But their older sisters and brothers had been talking of nothing else.

Loawnu sent the children back down the hill to search for all the pieces of the sky. They tried their best, but the children were worried. The wind had blown everything everywhere. What if they had missed some pieces?

The next day, the children ran outside. With great relief, they looked up at a bright blue sky. That night, when they looked up at the sky, they could not believe their eyes. The sky had always been dark at night. Loawnu had patched the sky with bright, twinkling lights, just in time for the Spring Festival."	myth		"cooperation, cleverness"
63	Wang the Peddler	"Once upon a time, a simple man named Wang lived in a village in long ago early Han times. Only a narrow, rough path led to this village, so merchants, officials, and travelers rarely visited. To sell his charcoal, Wang knew he must become the traveler, and make the journey to the city.
Wang shouldered his long carrying pole. At each end, swung wide bamboo baskets stacked high with charcoal.
""What present would you like me to bring you,"" he asked his pretty young wife.
""A comb!"" she cried. ""A beautiful comb like those of the imperial court!"" The combs they used in the country at that time were made of wood. ""A comb like that!"" she cried, pointing to the crescent of the golden moon.
After a long trip, Wang arrived safely at the city gates. He sold his charcoal for a good price. Made bold by the string of cash he now carried, he looked around the city for his wife's present. The city was so very pretty, with banners of red and yellow and green and blue hung from shop fronts and balconies. It was very noisy with the racket of shop men and shouting buyers.
Wang rubbed his chin. What was it his wife had wanted? He had forgotten! Perhaps a pair of leather slippers? Or a warm fur coat? It was getting dark. The shops would soon be closed. Early in the morning, he had to return to the village. Suddenly, he noticed the moon. It was round, so very round. She wanted something round, he thought. He looked in shop after shop for something to make his young wife happy.

She was married to the emperor. She was, in fact, his favorite wife. The emperor loved her stories. He loved his wife. Sadly, one day, the emperor's wife became ill and died.
Everyone thought the emperor would soon find another favorite among his wives, but the emperor was very sad. He spent more and more time in his garden, and less and less time caring for the needs of his people.
Everyone in the kingdom was worried. They were afraid that another clan might hear that their emperor had become weak. That would never do. A warring clan might attack the city. Many could die. Something had to be done, and done soon.
One day, a priest passed some children playing with their dolls. The dolls made dancing shadows on the wall of the city. This gave the priest an idea. He knew the stories the emperor's wife used to tell. What if he could bring those stories to life?
The priest made a puppet out of bits of clay. He painted the puppet to look somewhat like the emperor's wife. When the puppet was finished, the priest slipped into the emperor's garden, carrying his puppet, a candle, and a curtain. He placed the curtain near the emperor's chair. He placed his candle, his puppet, and himself behind the curtain. He waited for the emperor to appear.
The emperor did not even notice the curtain at first. It was the dancing shadow that drew his eyes. As the priest moved the puppet behind the curtain, he told wonderful stories of the emperor's wife. The priest told a story she used to tell, one of the emperor's favorites.
The emperor was entranced. He knew the priest was there. He knew the puppet was there. But it seemed as if the shadow was telling the story, as if his wife was spending time with him.
The emperor was no longer sad. At the end of each busy day, the emperor went into his garden, eager to visit his shadow wife and hear her stories once again.
That is how shadow puppets first began."	myth		"happiness, love, cleverness"
65	The Warrior and the Well	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, a woman was watering her sheep. Her husband had reminded her to be sure and cover the well tightly when she was done as water was scarce.
But when she was done watering the sheep, she forgot to close the well. Soon, the well filled and the water poured out. It flowed and flowed and flooded the grassland at the bottom of the hill. The sheep bleated in fright.
The woman tried to stop the flow of water by covering the well. But the water was moving too rapidly. It tossed the cover into the air and poured even more forcefully out of the well.
Just then, a warrior came riding by.
""Can you help me?"" the woman cried. ""I cannot stop the water!""
The warrior shot an arrow into the tallest mountain, splitting it in two. One part fell onto the well and stopped the water from pouring out.
The woman turned to the warrior, eager to thank him and to offer him food to eat when suddenly something occurred to her. She blurted, ""But how will I get to the water again? It is under a mountain.""
The warrior only bowed and smiled and went on his way.
When the woman realized that she had not offered food or greeting, she hung her head in shame."	historical		"cooperation, greed"
66	Legend of the Christmas Stocking	"Once upon a time, a long time ago, a poor man was worried his three daughters would never find husbands. He had no dowry to give them. Things are very different today, but a long time ago that was the was the custom, to give the husband something of value, a cow perhaps. The poor man had nothing to give. Some men in his village had offered to marry the girls even though they had no dowry. He knew what that meant. His girls would be looked down upon by some of the villagers. That simply was not how things were done.
The poor man slumped dismally outside his cottage. Christmas Eve and nothing to give his beloved daughters. No dowry, no good man to love. They were such kind girls, he mumbled.
Some say it was St. Nick who heard the man mumbling. Others say it was a complete stranger. Still others are sure it was the man who soon after married the eldest daughter.
All that is known is on Christmas Eve someone quietly entered the poor man's cottage, while everyone was asleep. He found the girls' stockings hanging by the fireplace to dry. A perfect place he thought to himself. He quietly filled the stockings with coins. Just as quietly, he went away.
The next morning, when the girls found their stockings filled with coins, they were so happy. All their problems had been solved by someone good and kind and generous.
Ever since, people have hung their stockings by the fireplace during the Christmas season in the hopes that they too might find a surprise tucked away inside on Christmas morning. Stranger things have happened, especially at Christmas, the season of giving."	myth		"sharing, happiness, kindness"
67	Marduk	"Marduk was not always the head god.  At one time, all the gods were equal.  But there was fighting amongst the gods.  One in particular, Tiamat was evil and hated the rest of the gods.  Now Tiamat was very powerful, and the other gods were afraid of her.
One of the other gods developed a plan.  Ea, the water god, knew that Marduk could defeat Tiamat. So, Ea went to Marduk and asked if he would be willing to fight Tiamat.
Marduk thought about it.  While he figured he could beat Tiamat, what if something went wrong?  What if she captured him or even killed him?  It had to be worth his efforts.  So Marduk came back to Ea with a deal.  He would fight Taimat if the rest of the gods would make him the head god forever.
Ea could not make that deal on his own.  He had to get the rest of the gods to agree, and he knew that some of them would oppose this idea, some because they were afraid of what would happen if Tiamat won and others because they didn't want another god to be able to boss them around.  But Ea was a very smart god.  He had a plan.
Ea called all the gods together in an assembly.  Ea provided the food, entertainment, and most of all the sweet, strong date wine so many of the gods loved.  After allowing the rest of the gods to feast and drink lots of date wine, Ea put the idea to them.  They agreed.  So, Ea went back to Marduk and let him know that if Marduk defeated Tiamat he would be the head god forever.
Marduk took a bow and arrows, his thunder club, his storm net, and his trademark - a lightning dagger - and set out to defeat Tiamat. The fighting that followed was stupendous.  The battle raged for days with Marduk killing monster and demon left and right.  Finally, he got close enough to Tiamat that he was able to throw his net over her.  Trapped, Tiamat turned to destroy Marduk with a magical killing scream.  Marduk was faster and shot an arrow down her throat killing her.  He then cut her body in half and put half of it in the heavens guarded by the twinkling lights we call stars and made sure that the moon was there to watch over her.  The rest he turned into the earth.
Now that Tiamat was dead, Marduk was the leader of all the gods."	myth		"cooperation, teamwork, strength, confidence, foresight"
68	The Myth of Romulus and Remus	"Rhea was a princess and a mortal woman who was married to Mars, the Roman god of war.  Rhea and Mars had twin sons and named them Romulus and Remus.  Some of the other gods were jealous of Mars and Rhea, and plotted to kill Romulus and Remus.  Rhea heard about the plot.  Since Mars was away she needed to protect the boys.

69	The Red Slippers	"Once upon a time, a long time ago in ancient Egypt, there lived a lovely slave girl named Rhapdosis. The other slaves who lived in the grand house by the Nile rarely spoke to Rhapdosis. If the truth be told, the slave girls were jealous of her beauty. The slave boys thought she was proud and haughty.

Certainly Rhapdosis was beautiful. But she was not haughty. She was gentle and shy. The only thing she had left from her former life was a pair of beautiful red slippers. Rhapdosis treasured her slippers and kept them hidden from the other slaves. Sometimes, when no one was about, Rhapdosis took her slippers from their hiding place and held them up to the sun or the moon. It always made her feel better, holding her slippers, watching the stones sparkle in the light. They were not real stones. Rhapdosis knew that. But they were beautiful just the same.
As careful as she was to hide her slippers, other slaves girls knew she had slippers covered in jewels, but they could not find them. Rhapdosis had hidden them well.
One night, Rhapdosis quietly slipped away from the rooftop where the other slaves were sleeping. It was a beautiful night. Rhapdosis took her slippers from their hiding place. She held one slipper up to the moon, feeling better than she had all day. Suddenly an eagle came out of nowhere and snatched her red slipper. Stunned, Rhapdosis slid the shoe she had left back into its hiding place. 
Far away, in another city entirely, Pharaoh was sitting in his garden. An eagle flew into the garden. The eagle dropped a bright red slipper into Pharaoh's lap, and soared away.
Pharaoh and the Vizier stared at each other in surprise.
""The woman who owns this slipper must be very rich!"" the Vizier decided. ""I can ask the officials in each city to see if anyone has reported a missing red slipper of great quality, covered with jewels.""
Four days later, one of the Vizier's officials reported he had found the young owner of the ruby red slipper. She was a slave in a great house on the Nile, in the city of Memphis. 
The Vizier did not believe a slave would own such a beautiful slipper. He decided to visit Memphis and see this slave girl for himself. When the Vizier demanded Rhapdosis prove she was the owner, she pulled the matching ruby red slipper from its hiding place.
The Vizier sat thinking for a moment. ""I believe Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris, sent Pharaoh an eagle with a message. You, my child, are coming with me, back to the palace.""
All the way back to the palace, the Vizier smiled and nodded. ""How surprised he'll be. And happy. I have no doubt he will be happy!""
He was right. Pharaoh and the slave girl soon fell in love. They were married in the spring, and lived happily ever after."	fairy tale		"appearance, beauty, happiness, love"
70	Osiris and Iris	"Once upon a time, a long time ago when the earth was new and everything was just beginning, the earth was covered with water. An egg floated on the water, just one egg. When that egg hatched, Ra was born. Ra did not want to spend his time floating around, doing nothing, so he flew into the sky and became the sun.
Ra dried up much of the water and made the land. Ra was lonely, so he made a wife. He named her Nut. Ra made many gods and goddesses to keep him company. He put them all to work. His children were very busy running the world. Still, they took time out to have children, because children were glorious things to have! Soon, there were many gods and goddesses. Ra was the father or the grandfather or the great-grandfather of them all!
All children are glorious, but to Ra, one child was especially important. That child was his grandson, Osiris. Osiris had a brother named Set. Ra thought Set was okay, I suppose, but his favorite by far was Osiris. To show Osiris how much he was loved, Ra made Osiris the first Pharaoh of Egypt. Osiris married Isis, his one true love, and they settled down quite happily with their son, Horus."	myth		"happiness, love"
71	The Legend of Osiris and Iris	"Set was terribly jealous. Why should Osiris be named Pharaoh and not him? In a fit of anger, Set killed his brother Osiris, and chopped him into little pieces. He threw the pieces into the Nile River. Set was sure he would get away this murder. But you know how rumors spread. Isis soon heard what Set had done.
Isis managed to gather the pieces of her beloved Osiris. She brought these pieces to her good friend Anubis, the jackal-headed god. Anubis was very clever. He managed to put the pieces of Osiris together again. But he did not have the power to bring him back to life, so that Osiris could retake his place beside his beloved Isis, and rule Egypt as king.
When the great Ra heard about it, he was furious. He gave Osiris a new job, an even better job. He made Osiris the god of the dead, which was the most important job of all. Osiris could rule over the land of the dead, and be dead himself. In fact, he would have to be dead to enter the land of the dead. So things worked out very well, or so Ra believed.
When the young prince Horus heard what his uncle Set had done, although he was still only a boy, he tracked down his uncle Set and murdered him.
Isis was grateful to her friend Anubis, and to her son Horus, and to her grandfather Ra. But nothing anyone could do would bring Osiris back to her. He would dwell forever in the land of the dead, and she would live forever in the land of the living. Isis knew that she would never see her beloved husband again.
In honor of the god Osiris, the kings (pharaohs) of Egypt carry a crook and a flail, the signs of Osiris. The crook especially became the sign of rulers. The crook looked a great deal like a snake and was made out of wood. They used wood because wood was scarce. That made it even more special.
From then on, and even today, once each year Isis travels to the riverbank. Remembering, and dreaming, tears fall from her eyes. That is why the Nile River rises each year, to bring life to everyone and everything along the Nile. When Isis cries, the Nile will rise!"	myth		"greed, cleverness perserverance, determination,  cooperation"
72	llamas  Legends	"There was a time when some people forgot the gods. They were greedy, and spent all their time fighting with each other instead of working in the fields and worshipping their gods. Only people high in the Andes Mountains behaved as people should.
The gods were not angry at the people who lived high in the mountains. They were not angry with the good llamas who served these people well. But they were very angry with the greedy people who lived in the valley below.
One day, the good people who lived high in the Andes Mountains noticed that their llamas were staring up at the sky. The llamas told the good people that the gods had told them that a terrible flood was coming and to hide as high in the mountains as they could.
So all the good people, and all the llamas packed food for a long stay, and climbed to the top of the mountain peaks, where the gods lived. They were just in time. The very next day, a big wave came. It was so big and so high that it almost reached the mountain peaks. The big wave swept all the bad people away."	myth		"greed, atonement, cooperation"
