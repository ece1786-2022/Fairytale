text = "There was once a group of five friends, who were all incredibly clever and inventive. They were always working together to come up with innovative solutions to the problems that faced their small town. One day, a mysterious object appeared in a field near the town. It was a large, round, black disc that no one had ever seen before. The five friends immediately went to investigate, and they quickly realized that the disc was no ordinary object. Using their cleverness and teamwork, the five friends managed to figure out that the disc was actually a spaceship. After a few days of careful examination, they were able to figure out how to open the door and enter the ship. Inside they found a strange and futuristic control room, filled with strange technology they had never seen before. They soon realized that with this technology, they could travel to distant galaxies and explore the unknown. The five friends quickly realized that they could be pioneers of a new space exploration mission, and that together they could unlock the mysteries of the universe. With excitement and enthusiasm, they began to plan their journey. And so, with the help of their cleverness, friendship and teamwork, the five friends set off on a journey to explore the universe, and to find out what lies beyond."

I met my fellow scientists, and we all had the same mission: to find out what was making strange noises coming from deep in the space station.We searched high and low, but no matter how hard we tried, we couldnâ€™t find the source of the mysterious noise. Until one day, I spotted something strange out of the corner of my eye. It was an alien spaceship!My team and I were both scared and excited. We knew that this could be our big chance to make a real difference. We had to be clever and use teamwork if we wanted to investigate the spaceship and find out what was making the noise.So, we used our cleverness, friendship, and teamwork to get inside the spaceship. What we found inside was a surprise. We discovered a tiny alien creature, one that had been trapped inside the spaceship for years.The alien was so excited to be free, and thanked us for rescuing him. We all celebrated with a big hug. We had not only solved the mystery of the strange noise, but we had also made a new friend!"
