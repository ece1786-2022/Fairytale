# Fairytale

## Introduction

Children’s tales are extremely important in child development as they improve literacy skills, communication skills, and assist with forming ideas of culture/race. Each story contains lessons that highlight important societal values and show children what is right and wrong. 

Our project, Fairytale, aims to allow anyone to generate a children’s tale given a simple prompt, the desired genre and grade level of the story, and some core values they want to appear in the text.

We believe the most appropriate approach is through machine learning as this is a text generation task. Based on the assignments and demonstrations from class, we think using transformer models like GPT-2 and GPT-3 would be most suitable.
